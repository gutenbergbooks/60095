</div>
<p class='c008'>ONCE upon a time very
long ago there lived an old
man in a glade in the
midst of an ancient forest.
His name was Witting, and
he lived there with his three
grandsons. Now this old
man was all alone in the
world save for these three
grandsons, and he had
been father and mother to
them from the time when they were quite little.
But now they were full-grown lads, so tall that
they came up to their grandfather’s shoulder, and
even taller. Their names were Bluster, Careful
and Quest.</p>
<p class='c009'>One spring morning old Witting got up early,
before the sun had risen, called his three grandsons
and told them to go into the wood where they
had gathered honey last year; to see how the little
bees had come through the winter, and whether
they had waked up yet from their winter sleep.
Careful, Bluster and Quest got up, dressed, and
went out.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a good way to the place where the bees
lived. Now all three brothers knew every pathway
in the woods, and so they strode cheerily and boldly
along through the great forest. All the same it
was somewhat dark and eerie under the trees, for
the sun was not yet up and neither bird nor beast
stirring. Presently the lads began to feel a little
scared in that great silence, because just at dawn,
before sunrise, the wicked Rampogusto, King of
Forest Goblins, loves to range the forest, gliding
softly from tree to tree in the gloom.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the brothers started to ask one another about
all the wonderful things there might be in the world.
But as not one of them had ever been outside the forest,
none could tell the others anything about the world;
and so they only became more and more depressed.
At last, to keep up their courage a bit, they began
to sing and call upon All-Rosy to bring out
the Sun:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Little lord All-Rosy bright.</div>
      <div class='line'>Bring golden Sun to give us light;</div>
      <div class='line'>Show thyself, All-Rosy bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>Loora-la, Loora-la lay!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Singing at the top of their voices, the lads
walked through the woods towards a spot from
where they could see a second range of mountains.
As they neared the spot they saw a light above
those mountains brighter than they had ever seen
before, and it fluttered like a golden banner.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lads were dumbfounded with amazement,
when all of a sudden the light vanished from off
the mountain and reappeared above a great rock
nearer at hand, then still nearer, above an old limetree,
and at last shone like burnished gold right in
front of them. And then they saw that it was a
lovely youth in glittering raiment, and that it was
his golden cloak which fluttered like a golden banner.
They could not bear to look upon the face of the
youth, but covered their eyes with their hands for
very fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why do you call me, if you are afraid of
me, you silly fellows?” laughed the golden youth—for
he was All-Rosy. “You call on All-Rosy,
and then you are afraid of All-Rosy. You talk
about the wide world, but you do not know the
wide world. Come along with me and I will show
you the world, both earth and heaven, and tell
you what is in store for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus spoke All-Rosy, and twirled his golden
cloak so that he caught up Bluster, Careful and
Quest, all three in its shimmering folds. Round
went All-Rosy and round went the cloak, and the
brothers, clinging to the hem of the cloak, spun
round with it, round and round and round again,
and all the world passed before their eyes. First
they saw all the treasure and all the lands and all
the possessions and the riches that were then in
the world. And they went on whirling round and
round and round again, and saw all the armies,
and all spears and all arrows and all the captains
and all plunder which were then in the world. And
the cloak twirled yet more quickly, round and round
and round again, and all of a sudden they saw all
the stars, great and small, and the moon and the
Seven Sisters and the winds and all the clouds.
The brothers were quite dazed with so many sights,
and still the cloak went on twirling and whirling
with a rustling, rushing sound like a golden banner.
At last the golden hem fluttered down; and Bluster,
Careful and Quest stood once more on the turf.
Before them stood the golden youth All-Rosy as
before, and said to them:</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, my lads, now you have seen all there
is to see in the world. Listen to what is in store
for you and what you must do to be lucky.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At that the brothers became more scared than
ever, yet they pricked up their ears and paid good
heed, so as to remember everything very carefully.
But All-Rosy went on at once:</p>

<p class='c009'>“There! this is what you must do. Stay in
the glade, and don’t leave your grandfather until
he leaves you; and do not go into the world,
neither for good nor for evil, until you have repaid
your grandfather for all his love to you.” And as
All-Rosy said this, he twirled his cloak round and
vanished, as though he had never been; and lo,
it was day in the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Rampogusto, King of the Forest Goblins,
had seen and heard everything. Like a wraith of
mist he had slipped from tree to tree and kept
himself hidden from the brothers among the branches
of an old beech-tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rampogusto had always hated old Witting. He
hated him as a mean scoundrel hates an upright
man, and above all things he hated him because the
old man had brought the sacred fire to the glade
so that it might never go out, and the smoke of
that fire made Rampogusto cough most horribly.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Rampogusto wasn’t pleased with the idea
that the brothers should obey All-Rosy, and stay
beside their grandfather and look after him; but
he bethought himself how he could harm old Witting,
and somehow turn his grandsons against him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i016a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>Therefore, no sooner had Bluster, Careful and
Quest recovered from their amazement and turned
to go home than Rampogusto slipped swiftly, like
a cloud before the wind, to a wooded glen where
there was a big osier clump, which was chock-full
of goblins—tiny, ugly, humpy, grubby, boss-eyed,
and what not, all playing about like mad creatures.
They squeaked and they squawked, they jumped
and they romped; they were a pack of harum-scarum
imps, no good to anybody and no harm either, so
long as a man did not take them into his company.
But Rampogusto knew how to manage that.</p>

<p class='c009'>So he picked out three of them, and told them
to jump each on one of the brothers, and see how
they might harm old Witting through his grandsons.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now while Rampogusto was busy choosing his
goblins, Bluster, Careful and Quest went on their
way; and so scared were they that they clean forgot
all they had seen during their flight and everything
that All-Rosy had told them.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they came back to the cabin, and sat down
on a stone outside and told their grandfather what
had happened to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what did you see as you were flying round,
and what did All-Rosy tell you?” Witting asked
Careful, his eldest grandson. Now Careful was in
a real fix, because he had clean forgotten, neither
could he remember what All-Rosy had told him.
But from under the stone where they were sitting
crept a wee hobgoblin—ugly and horned and grey
as a mouse.</p>

<p class='c009'>The goblin tweaked Careful’s shirt from behind
and whispered: “Say: I have seen great riches,
hundreds of beehives, a house of carved wood and
heaps of fine furs. And All-Rosy said to me: ‘Thou
shalt be the richest of all the three brothers.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Careful never bothered to think whether this
was the truth that the imp was suggesting, but just
turned and repeated it word for word to his grandfather.
No sooner had he spoken than the goblin
hopped into his pouch, curled himself up in a corner
of the pouch—and there stopped!</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Witting asked Bluster, the second grandson,
what he might have seen in his flight, and what All-Rosy
might have told him? And Bluster, too, had
noticed nothing and remembered nothing. But from
under the stone crept the second hobgoblin, quite
small, ill-favoured, horned and smutty as a polecat.
The goblin plucked Bluster by the shirt and
whispered: “Say: I saw lots of armed men, many
bows and arrows and slaves galore in chains. And
All-Rosy said to me: ‘Thou shalt be the mightiest
of the brothers.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bluster considered no more than Careful had
done, but was very pleased, and lied to his grandfather
even as the goblin had prompted him. And
the goblin at once jumped on his neck and crawled
down his shirt, hid in his bosom, and stopped there.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the grandfather asked the youngest grandson,
Quest, but he, too, could recall nothing. And
from under the stone crept the third hobgoblin,
the youngest, the ugliest, horned with big horns,
and black as a mole.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hobgoblin tugged Quest by the shirt and
whispered: “Say: I have seen all the heavens and
all the stars and all clouds. And All-Rosy said to
me: ‘Thou shalt be the wisest among men and
know what the winds say and the stars tell.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Quest loved the truth, and so he would not
listen to the goblin nor lie to his grandfather, but
kicked the goblin and said to his grandfather:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know, grandfather, what I saw or what
I heard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The goblin gave a squeal, bit Quest’s foot, and
then scuttled away under the stone like a lizard.
But Quest gathered potent herbs and bound up his
foot with them, so that it might heal quickly.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>II</h3>

<p class='c011'>Now the goblin whom Quest had kicked first
scooted away under the stone, and then wriggled into
the grass, and hopped off through the grass into the
woods, and through the woods into the osier clump.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went up to Rampogusto all shaking with
fright and said: “Rampogusto, dread sovereign, I
wasn’t able to jump on that youth whom you gave
into my care.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Rampogusto fell into a frightful rage,
because he knew those three brothers well, and most
of all he feared Quest, lest he should remember the
truth. For if Quest were to remember the truth,
why, then Rampogusto would never be able to get
rid of old Witting nor the sacred fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>So he seized the little goblin by the horns, picked
him up and dusted him soundly with a big birchrod.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go back!” he roared—“go back to the young
man, and it will be a black day for you if ever he
remembers the truth!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these words Rampogusto let the goblin
go; and the goblin, scared half out of his wits,
squatted for three days in the osier clump and considered
and considered how he might fulfil his difficult
task. “I shall have as much trouble with Quest,
for sure, as Quest with me,” reflected the goblin.
For he was a scatter-brained little silly, and did not
care at all for a tiresome job.</p>

<p class='c009'>But while he squatted in the osier clump those
other two imps were already at work, the one in
Careful’s pouch and the other in Bluster’s bosom.
From that day forth Careful and Bluster began to
rove over hill and dale, and even slept but little at
home—and all because of the goblins!</p>

<p class='c009'>There was the goblin curled up in the bottom
of Careful’s pouch, and that goblin loved riches
better than the horn over his right eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>So all day long he butted Careful in the ribs,
teasing and goading him on: “Hurry up, get on!
We must seek, we must find! Let’s look for bees,
let’s gather honey, and then we will keep a tally
with rows and rows of scores!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So said the goblin, because in those days they
reckoned up a man’s possessions with tallies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now a tally is only a long wooden stick with
a notch cut in it for every sum that is owing to a
man!</p>

<p class='c009'>But Bluster’s goblin butted him in the breast,
and that goblin wanted to be the strongest of all
and lord of all the earth. So he worried and worried
Bluster, and urged him to roam through the woods
looking for young ash plants and slender maple
saplings to make a warrior’s outfit and weapons.
“Hurry up, get on!” teased the goblin. “You must
seek, you must find! Spears, bows and arrows to
suit a hero’s mind, so that man and beast may tremble
before us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And both Bluster and Careful listened to their
goblins, and went off after their own concerns as the
goblins led them.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Quest stayed with his grandfather that day
and yet other three days, and all the time he puzzled
and puzzled over whatever it was that All-Rosy might
have told him; because Quest wanted to tell his
grandfather the truth; but, alas! he could not
remember it at all!</p>

<p class='c009'>So that day went by, and the next, and so three
days; and on the third day Quest said to his
grandfather:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-bye, grandfather. I am going to the
hills, and shall not come back until I remember
the truth, if it should take me ten years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Witting’s hair was grey, and there was
little he cared for in this world except his grandson
Quest, and him he loved and cherished as a withered
leaf cherishes a drop of dew. So the old man started
sadly and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What good will the truth be to me, my boy,
when I may be dead and gone long before you
remember it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>This he said, and in his heart he grieved far
more even than he showed in his words; and
he thought: “How could the boy leave me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Quest replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must go, grandfather, because I have thought
it out, and that seems the right thing to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Witting was a wise old man, and considered:
“Perhaps there is more wisdom in a young head
than in an old one; only if the poor lad is
doing wrong it’s a sad weird he will have to
dree—because he is so gentle and upright.” And
as Witting thought of that he grew sadder than
ever, but said nothing more. He just kissed his
grandson good-bye and bade him go where he wished.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Quest’s heart sadly misgave him because
of his grandfather, and he very, very nearly changed
his mind on the threshold and stayed beside him.
But he forced himself to do as he had made up his
mind to, and went out and away into the hills.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just as Quest parted from his grandfather his
imp thought he might as well get out of the osier
clump and tackle that tiresome job; and he reached
the clearing just as Quest was hurrying away.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Quest went off to the hills, very downcast
and sad; and when he came to the first rock, lo
and behold, there was the goblin, gibbering.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why,” thought Quest, “it’s the very same
one—quite small, misshapen, black as a mole and
with big horns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The goblin stood right in Quest’s way, and
would not let him pass. So Quest got angry with
the little monster for hindering him like this; he
picked up a stone, threw it at the goblin, and hit
him squarely between the horns. “Now I’ve killed
him,” thought Quest.</p>

<p class='c009'>But when he looked again there was the goblin
as spry as ever, and two more horns had sprouted
where the stone had hit him!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, evidently stones won’t drive him off,”
said Quest. So he went round the goblin and
forward on his way. But the imp scuttled on in
front of him, to the right and to the left, and then
straight in front, for all the world like a rabbit.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last they came to a little level spot between
cliffs—a very stony place; and on one side of it
there was a deep well-spring. “Here will I stay,”
said Quest; and he at once spread out his sheep-skin
coat under a crab-tree and sat down, so that
he might reflect in peace and remember what All-Rosy
had verily and truly told him.</p>

<p class='c009'>But when the imp saw that, he squatted down
straight in front of Quest under the tree, played
silly tricks on him, and worried him horribly. He
chased lizards under Quest’s feet, threw burrs at
his shirt, and slipped grasshoppers up his sleeves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh dear, this is most annoying!” thought
Quest, when it had gone on for some little
time. “I have left my wise old grandfather, my
brothers and my home, so that I might be in
quiet and remember the truth—and here am I
wasting my time with this horned imp of
mischief!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But as he had come out in a good cause, he
nevertheless thought it the right thing to stay where
he was.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>III</h3>

<p class='c011'>So Quest and the goblin lived together on that
lone ledge between the cliffs, and each day was
like the first. The goblin worried Quest so that he
couldn’t get on with his thinking.</p>

<p class='c009'>On a clear morning Quest would rise from
sleep and feel happy. “How still it is, how lovely!
Surely to-day I shall remember the truth!” And
lo, from the branch overhead a handful of crabs
would come tumbling about his ears, so that his head
buzzed and his thoughts all got mixed. And there
was the little monster mocking him from the crabtree
and laughing fit to burst. Or Quest would be
lying in the shade, thinking most beautifully, till
he felt like saying: “There, there now, <i>now</i> it will
come back to me, <i>now</i> I shall puzzle out the truth!”
And then the goblin would squirt him all over with
ice-cold water from the spring through a hollow
elder twig—and again Quest would clean forget what
he had already thought out.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no silly trick nor idle joke that
the goblin did not play on Quest on the ledge
there. And yet all might have been well, if
Quest hadn’t found it just a tiny bit amusing to
watch these tomfooleries; and though he was thinking
hard about his task, yet his eyes <i>would</i> wander
and look round to see what the imp might be
doing next.</p>

<p class='c009'>Quest was angry with himself over this, because
he was wearying more and more for his grandfather,
and he saw full well that he would never
remember the truth while the goblin was about.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must get rid of him,” said Quest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, one fine morning the goblin invented a
new game. He climbed up the cliff where there
was a steep water-course in the face of the rock,
got astride a smooth bit of wood as if it had been
a hobby-horse, and then scooted down the water-course
like a streak of lightning! This prank
pleased the little wretch so mightily that he must
needs have company to enjoy it the better! So he
whistled on a blade of grass till it rang over hill
and dale, and lo, from scrub and rock and osier
clump the goblins came scuttling along, all tiny
like himself. He gave orders, and every man-jack
of them took a stick and shinned up the cliff with
it. My word! how they got astride their hobby-horses
and hurtled down the water-course! There
were all sorts and sizes and kinds of goblins—red
as a robin’s breast, green as greenfinches, woolly
as lambs, naked as frogs, horned as snails, bald as
mice. They careered down the water-course like
a crazy company on crazy horses. Down they flew,
each close at the other’s heels, never stopping till
they came to the middle of the ledge; and there
was a great stone all overgrown with moss. There
they were brought up short, and what with the
bump of stopping so suddenly and sheer high
spirits they tumbled and scrambled about all atop
of one another in the moss!</p>

<p class='c009'>Shrieking with glee, the silly crew had made
the trip some two or three times already, and poor
Quest was hard put to it between two thoughts.
For one thing, he wanted to watch the imps and
be amused by them, and for another he was angry
with them for making such a hullabaloo that he
could not remember the truth. So he shilly-shallied
awhile, and at last he said: “Well, this is past a
joke. I must get rid of these good-for-nothing loons,
because while they are here I might as well have
stopped at home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And as Quest considered the matter, he noticed
that as they rushed down the water-course they
made straight for the spring, and that, but for the
big stone, they would all have toppled into it head
foremost. So Quest crouched behind the stone, and
when the imps came dashing down again guffawing
and chuckling as before, he quickly rolled the stone
aside, and the whole mad party rushed straight on
to the well-spring—right on to it and then into it,
head first, each on top of the other—red as robin’s
breasts, green as greenfinches, woolly as lambs, naked
as frogs, horned as snails, bald-headed as mice—and
first of all the one who had fastened himself
on to Quest....</p>

<p class='c009'>And then Quest tipped a big flat stone over the
well, and all the goblins were caught inside like flies
in a pitcher.</p>

<p class='c009'>Quest was ever so pleased to have got rid of
the goblins, sat down and made sure he would now
recollect the truth in good earnest.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he had no luck, because down in the well
the goblins began to wriggle and to ramp as never
before. Through every gap and chink shot up tiny
flames which the goblins gave out in their fright
and distress. The flames danced and wavered round
the spring till Quest’s head was all in a whirl. He
closed his eyes, so that their flashing should not
make him giddy.</p>

<p class='c009'>But then there arose from the pit such a noise,
hubbub, knocking and banging, barking and yowling,
such yelling and shrieking for help, that Quest’s
ears were like to burst; and how could he even try
to think through it? He stopped his ears so as not
to hear.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then a smell of brimstone and sulphur drifted
over to him. Through every crack and crevice
oozed thick sooty smoke which the imps belched
forth in their extremity. Smoke and sulphur fumes
writhed round Quest; they choked and smothered
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Quest saw there was no help for it. “Goblins
shut up,” said he, “are a hundred times worse than
goblins at large. So I’ll just go and let them out,
since I can’t get rid of them anyhow. After all, I
am better off with their tomfooleries than with all
that yammering.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So he went and lifted off the stone; and
the terrified goblins scuttled away in all directions
like so many wild cats, and ran away into the
woods and never came back to the ledge any
more.</p>

<p class='c009'>None stayed behind, but only the one black
as a mole and with big horns, because he did not
dare to leave Quest for fear of Rampogusto.</p>

<p class='c009'>But even he sobered down a little from that
day forward, and had more respect for Quest than
before.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so these two came to a sort of arrangement
between them; they got used to one another and
lived side by side on the stony ledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>In that way close on to a year slipped by, and
Quest was no nearer remembering what All-Rosy
had really truly told him.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the year was almost gone the goblin began
to be most horribly bored.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much longer have I got to stick here?”
thought he. So one evening, just as Quest was
about to fall asleep, the imp wriggled up to him and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my friend, here you’ve been sitting
for close on a year and a day, and what’s the good
of it? Who knows but perhaps in the meantime
your old grand-dad has died all alone in his
cabin.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i032a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>A pang shot through Quest’s heart as if he had
been struck with a knife, but he said: “There,
I have made up my mind not to budge from here
until I remember the truth, because truth comes
before all things.” Thus said Quest, because he
was upright and of good parts.</p>

<p class='c009'>But all the same he was deeply troubled by
what the goblin had said about his grandfather. He
never slept a wink all night, but racked his brains
and thought: “How is it with the old man, my
dear grandfather?”</p>
<h3 class='c007'>IV</h3>

<p class='c011'>Now all this time the grandfather went on living
with Careful and Bluster in the glade—only life
had taken a very sad turn for the old man. His
grandsons ceased to trouble about him, nor would
they stay near him. They bade him neither “Good-morning”
nor “Good-night,” and only went about
their own affairs and listened to the goblins they
harboured, the one in his pouch and the other in
his bosom.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every day Careful brought more bees from the
forest, felled timber, shaped rafters, and gradually
built a new cabin. He carved himself ten tallies, and
every day he counted and reckoned over and over
again when these tallies would be filled up.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Bluster, he went hunting and reiving,
bringing home game and furs, plunder and treasure;
and one day he even brought along two slaves whom
he had taken, so that they might work for the
brothers and wait upon them.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this was very hard and disagreeable for the
old man, and harder and more disagreeable still
were the looks he got from his grandsons. What
use had they for an old man who would not be
served by the slaves, but disgraced his grandsons by
cutting wood and drawing water from the well for
himself? At last there wasn’t a thing about the
old man that didn’t annoy his grandsons, even this,
that every day he would put a log on the sacred fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Witting saw very well whither all this
would lead, and that very soon they would be
thinking of getting rid of him altogether. He did
not care so much about his life, because life was
not much use to him, but he was sorry to die before
seeing Quest once more, the dear lad who was the
joy of his old age.</p>

<p class='c009'>One evening—and it was the very evening when
Quest was so troubled in his mind thinking of his
grandfather—Careful said to Bluster: “Come along,
brother, let’s get rid of grandfather. You have
weapons. Wait for him by the well and kill
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Careful said this because he specially
wanted the old cabin at all costs, so as to put up
beehives on that spot. “I can’t,” replied Bluster,
whose heart had not grown so hard, amidst bloodshed
and robbery, as Careful’s among his riches and his
tallies.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Careful would not give over, because the
imp in his bag went on whispering and nagging.
The imp in his pouch knew very well that Careful
would be the first to put the old man away, and
so gain him great credit with Rampogusto.</p>

<p class='c009'>Careful tried hard to talk over Bluster, but
Bluster could not bring himself to kill his grandfather
with his own hand. So at last they agreed
and arranged that they would that very night burn
down the old man’s hut—burn it down with the
old man inside!</p>

<p class='c009'>When all was quiet in the glade, they sent out
the slaves to watch the traps in the woods that
night. But the brothers crept up softly to Witting’s
cabin, shut the outer door tight with a thick wedge,
so that the old man might not escape from the
flames, and then set fire to the four corners of the
house....</p>

<p class='c009'>When all was done they went away and away
into the hills so as not to hear their poor old grandfather
crying out for help. They made up their
minds to go over the whole of the mountain as far
as they could, and not to come back until next day,
when all would be over, and their grandfather and
the cabin would be burnt up together.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they went, and the flames began to lick upwards
slowly round the corners. But the rafters were of
seasoned walnut, hard as stone, and though the fire
licked and crept all round them it could not catch
properly, and so it was late at night before the
flames took hold of the roof.</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Witting awoke, opened his eyes and saw
that the roof was ablaze over his head. He got up
and went to the door, and when he found that it
was fastened with a heavy wedge he knew at once
whose doing it was.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my children! my poor darlings!” said the
old man, “you have taken from your hearts to add
to your wretched tallies; and behold, your tallies
are not even full, and there are many notches still
lacking; but your hearts are empty to the bottom
already, since you could burn your own grandfather
and the cabin where you were born.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That was all the thought that Father Witting
gave to Careful and Bluster. After that he thought
neither good nor bad about them, nor did he grieve
over them further, but went and sat down quietly
to wait for death.</p>

<p class='c009'>He sat on the oak chest and meditated upon his
long life; and whatever there had been in it, there
was nothing he was sorry for save only this, that
Quest was not with him in his last hour—Quest,
his darling child, for whom he had grieved so
much.</p>

<p class='c009'>So he sat still, while the roof was already
blazing away like a torch.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rafters burned and burned, the ceiling
began to crack. It blazed, cracked, then gave way
on either side of the old man, and rafters and ceiling
crashed down amid the flames into the cabin. The
flames billowed round Witting, the roof gaped above
his head. Already he saw the dawn pale in the sky
before sunrise. Old Witting rose to his feet, raised
his hands to heaven, and so waited for the flames
to carry him away from this world, the old man
and his old homestead together.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>V</h3>

<p class='c011'>Quest worried terribly that night, and when
morning broke he went to the spring to cool his
burning face.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun was just up in the sky when Quest
reached the spring, and when he came there he saw
a light shining in the water. It shone, it rose, and
lo! beside the spring and before Quest stood a
lovely youth in golden raiment. It was All-Rosy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Quest started with joy, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My little lord All-Rosy bright, how I have
longed for you! Do tell me what you told me then
that I must do? Here I have been racking my
brains and tormenting myself and calling on all my
wits for a year and a day—and I cannot remember
the truth!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Quest said this, All-Rosy rather crossly shook
his head and his golden curls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh, boy, boy! I told you to stay with your
grandfather till you had rendered him the love you
owe him, and not to leave him till he left you,” said
All-Rosy.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then he went on:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought you were wiser than your brothers,
and there you are the most foolish of the three.
Here you have been racking your brains and calling
on your wits to help you for a year and a day so
that you might remember the truth; and if you had
listened to your heart when it told you on the
threshold of your cabin to turn back and not to
leave your old grandfather—why then, you silly
boy, you would have had the truth, even without
wits!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus spoke All-Rosy. Once more he crossly
shook his head with the golden curls; then he took
his golden cloak about him and vanished.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shamed and troubled, Quest remained alone
beside the spring, and from between the stones he
heard the imp giggling—the hobgoblin, quite small,
misshapen, and horned with big horns. The little
wretch was pleased because All-Rosy had shamed
Quest, who always gave himself such righteous airs;
but when Quest roused himself from his first amazement
he called out joyfully:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I’ll just wash quickly and then fly to my
dear old grandfather.” This he said and knelt by
the spring to wash. Quest leaned down to reach
the water, leaned down too far, lost his balance, and
fell into the spring.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fell into the spring and was drowned....</p>
<h3 class='c007'>VI</h3>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i041.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c012'>THE hobgoblin jumped
up from among the
stones, leaped to the
edge of the spring, and
looked down to see with
his own eyes whether it
was really true.</p>
<p class='c009'>Yes, Quest was really
truly drowned. There
he lay at the bottom of
the water, white as wax.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yoho, yoho, yo
hey!” yelled the goblin,
who was only a poor silly. “Yoho, yoho, yo hey!
my friend, we’re off to-day!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The imp yelled so that all the rocks round the
ledge rang with the noise. Then he heaved up the
stone that lay by the edge of the spring, and the
stone toppled over and covered the spring like a
lid. Next the imp flung Quest’s skin-coat on the top
of the stone; last of all he went and sat on the
coat, and then he began to skip and to frolic.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yoho, yoho! my job is done!” yelled the
goblin.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it wasn’t for long that he skipped on the
skin; it wasn’t for long that he yelled.</p>

<p class='c009'>For when the goblin had tired himself out, he
looked round the ledge, and a queer feeling came
over him.</p>

<p class='c009'>You see, the goblin had got used to Quest.
Never before had he had such an easy time as with
that good youth. He had been allowed to fool about
as he chose, without anybody scolding him or
telling him to stop; and now that he came to think
of it, he would have to go back to the osier clump,
to the mire, to his angry King Rampogusto, and go
on repeating the old goblin chatter among five
hundred other goblins—all of them just as he used
to be himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had lost the habit of it. He began to think—to
<i>think</i> a very little. He began to feel sad—just
a little sad, then more and more miserable; and
at last he was wringing and beating his hands, and
the silly, thoughtless goblin, who a minute ago had
been yelling with glee, was now weeping and wailing
with grief and rolling about on the coat all crazy
with distress.</p>

<p class='c009'>He wept and he howled till all his former yelling
was clean nothing in comparison. For a goblin is
always a goblin. Once he starts wailing he wails
with a vengeance. And he pulled the fur out of the
skin-coat in handfuls, and rolled about on it as if
he had taken leave of his senses.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now just at that moment Bluster and Careful
came to the lone ledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had wandered all over the mountain, and
were now on their way home to the glade to see if
their grandfather and the cabin were quite burnt
up. On the way back they came to a lone ledge
where they had never been before.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bluster and Careful heard something wailing, and
caught sight of Quest’s skin-coat; and they thought
at once that Quest must have come to grief somehow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not that they felt sorry for their brother
because they could not grieve for anybody while the
goblins were about them.</p>

<p class='c009'>But at that moment their goblins began to wriggle,
because they could hear that one of their own
kind was in trouble. Now there is no sort that
sticks more closely together and none more faithful
in trouble than the hobgoblins were. In the osier
clump they would fight and squabble all day; but
if there was trouble each would give the skin off his
shins for the other!</p>

<p class='c009'>So they wriggled and they worried; they pricked
up their ears, and then peered out, the one from the
pouch and the other from the shirt. And as they
peered they at once saw a brother of theirs rolling
about with somebody or something—rolling and
writhing, and nothing to be seen but the fur flying.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A wild beast is worrying him!” cried the
terrified goblins. They jumped out, one out of
Careful’s pouch and the other out of Bluster’s
bosom, and scuttled off to help their friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>But when they reached him, he would still do
nothing but roll about on the skin and howl:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The boy is dead!—the boy is dead!” The
other two goblins tried to quiet him, and thought:
“Maybe a thorn has got into his paw, or a midge
into his ear”—because they had never lived with
a righteous man, and did not know what it means
to lament for others.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the first goblin went on wailing so that you
couldn’t hear yourself speak, and he wouldn’t be
comforted either.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the other goblins were in a fine taking as
to what they were to do with him? Nor could they
leave him there in his sore trouble. At last they had
an idea. Each laid hold of the sheep-skin coat by one
sleeve, and so they dragged along the coat with their
brother inside, scuttled away into the woods, and
out of the woods into the osier clump and home to
Rampogusto.</p>

<p class='c009'>So for the first time for a year and a day
Bluster and Careful were quit of their goblins. When
the imps hopped away from them, the brothers felt
as though they had walked the world like blind men
for a year and a day, and were seeing it plainly again
now for the first time there on the rocky ledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>First they looked at each other in a maze, and
then they knew at once what a terrible wrong they
had done their grandfather.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Brother! kinsman!” each cried to the other,
“let us fly and save our grandfather.” And they
flew as if they had falcon’s wings, home to the
clearing.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they came to the glade the cabin was
roofless. Flames were rising like a column from the
hut. Only the walls and the door were still standing,
and the door was still tightly wedged.</p>

<p class='c009'>The brothers hurried up, tore out the wedge,
rushed into the cabin, and carried out the old man
in their arms from amid the flames, which were just
going to take hold on his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>They carried him out and laid him on the cool
green turf, and then they stood beside him and
neither dared speak a word.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a while old Witting opened his eyes, and
as he saw them he asked nothing about them. The
only question he put was:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you find Quest anywhere in the mountain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, grandfather,” answered the brothers.
“Quest is dead. He was drowned this morning in
the well-spring. But, grandfather, forgive us, and
we will serve you and wait upon you like slaves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As they were speaking thus, old Witting arose
and stood upon his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see that you are already forgiven, my
children,” said he, “since you are standing here
alive. But he who was the most upright of you
three had to pay with his life for his fault. Come,
children, take me to the place where he died.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Humbly penitent, Careful and Bluster supported
their grandfather as they led him to the ledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>But when they had walked a little while they
saw that they had gone astray, and had never been
that way before. They told their grandfather; but
he just bade them keep on in that path.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they came to a steep slope, and the road led
up the slope right to the crest of the mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our grandfather will die,” whispered the
brothers, “with him so feeble and the hillside so
steep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But old Witting only said: “On, children, on—follow
the path.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they began to climb up the track, and the
old man grew ever more grey and pallid in the
face. And on the mountain’s crest there was something
fair that rustled and crooned and sparkled
and shone.</p>

<p class='c009'>And when they reached the crest, they stood
silent and stone still for very wonder and awe.</p>

<p class='c009'>For before them was neither hill nor dale, nor
mountain nor plain, nor anything at all, but only
a great white cloud stretched out before them like
a great white sea—a white cloud, and on the white
cloud a pink cloud. Upon the pink cloud stood a
glass mountain, and on the glass mountain a golden
castle with wide steps leading up to the gates.</p>

<p class='c009'>That was the Golden Castle of All-Rosy. A
soft light streamed from the Castle—some of it
from the pink cloud, some from the glass mountain,
and some from the pure gold walls; but most of
all from the windows of the Castle itself. For there
sit the guests of All-Rosy, drinking from golden
goblets health and welcome to each new-comer.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i048a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>But All-Rosy does not enjoy the company of
such as harbour any guilt in their souls, nor will he
let them into his Castle. Wherefore it is a noble
and chosen company that is assembled in his courts,
and from them streams the light through the windows.</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon the ridge stood old Witting with his
grandsons, all speechless as they gazed at the marvel.
They looked—and of a sudden they saw someone
sitting on the steps that led to the Castle. His face
was hidden in his hands and he wept.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old man looked and knew him—knew him
for Quest.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old man’s soul was shaken within him. He
roused himself and called out across the cloud:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What ails you, my child?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am here, grandfather,” answered Quest. “A
great light lifted me up out of the well-spring and
brought me here. So far have I come; but they
won’t let me into the Castle, because I have sinned
against you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tears ran down the old man’s cheeks. His
hands and heart went out to caress his dear child,
to comfort him, to help him, to set his darling free.</p>

<p class='c009'>Careful and Bluster looked at their grandfather, but
his face was altogether changed. It was ashen, it was
haggard, and not at all like the face of a living man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The old man will die of these terrors,”
whispered the brothers to each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the old man drew himself up to his full
height, and already he was moving away from them,
when he looked back once more and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go home, children, back to the glade, since
you are forgiven. Live and enjoy in all righteousness
what shall fall to your part. But I go to help him to
whom has been given the best part at the greatest cost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Witting’s voice was quite faint, but he stood
before them upright as a dart.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bluster and Careful looked at one another. Had
their grandfather gone crazy, that he thought of
walking across the clouds when he had no breath
even for speech?</p>

<p class='c009'>But already the old man had left them. He
left them, went on and stepped out upon the cloud
as though it were a meadow. And as he stepped out
he went forward. On he walked, the old man, and
his feet carried him as though he were a feather,
and his cloak fluttered in the wind as if it were a
cloud upon that cloud. Thus he came to the pink
cloud, and to the glass mountain, and to the broad
steps. He flew up the steps to his grandson. Oh
the joy of it, when the old man clasped his grandson!
He hugged him and he held him close as
if he would never let him go. And Careful and
Bluster heard it all. Across the cloud they could
hear the old man and his grandchild weeping in
each other’s arms for pure joy!</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the old man took Quest by the hand and led
him up to the Castle gates. With his left hand he led
his grandson, and with his right he knocked at the gate.</p>

<p class='c009'>And lo, a wonder! At once the great gates flew
open, all the splendour of the Castle was thrown
open, and the company within, the noble guests,
welcomed grandfather Witting and grandson Quest
upon the threshold.</p>

<p class='c009'>They welcomed them, held out their hands to
them, and led them in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Careful and Bluster just saw them pass by the
window, and saw where they were placed at the
table. The first place of all was given to old Witting,
and beside him sat Quest, where All-Rosy, the golden
youth, drinks welcome to his guests from a goblet
of gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>A great fear fell upon Bluster and Careful when
they were left alone with these awesome sights.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come away, brother, to our clearing,”
whispered Careful; and they turned and went. Bewildered
by many marvels, they got back to their
clearing, and never again could they find either the
path or the slope that led to the mountain’s crest.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>VII</h3>

<p class='c011'>Thus it was and thus it befell.</p>

<p class='c009'>Careful and Bluster went on living in the glade.
They lived long as valiant men and true, and
brought up goodly families, sons and grandsons.
All good parts went down from father to son, and,
of course, also the sacred fire, which was fed with
a fresh log every day so that it might never go
out.</p>

<p class='c009'>So, you see, Rampogusto was right in being
afraid of Quest, because if Quest had not died
in his search for truth those goblins would never
have left Careful and Bluster, and in the glade there
would have been neither righteous men nor sacred
fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>But so everything fell out. To the great shame
and discomfiture of Rampogusto and all his crew.</p>

<p class='c009'>When those two goblins dragged Quest’s sheep-skin
before Rampogusto, and inside it the third
goblin, who was still yammering and carrying on
like one demented, Rampogusto flew into a furious
rage, for he knew that all three youths had escaped
him. In his great wrath he gave orders that all
three goblins should have their horns cropped close,
and so run about for everyone to make fun of!</p>

<p class='c009'>But the worst of Rampogusto’s discomfiture was
this: Every day the sacred smoke gets into his
throat and makes him cough most horribly. Moreover,
he never dare venture out into the woods for
fear of meeting some one of the valiant people.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Rampogusto got nothing out of it but Quest’s
cast-off sheep-skin; and I’m sure he is welcome to
that, for Quest doesn’t want a sheep-skin coat anyhow
in All-Rosy’s Golden Halls.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c004'>Fisherman Plunk and His Wife</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c007'>I</h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>FISHERMAN PLUNK was sick and tired of
his miserable life. He lived alone by the
desolate sea-shore, and every day he caught
fish with a bone hook, because they didn’t
know about nets in those parts at that time. And
how much fish can you catch with a hook, anyhow?</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a dog’s life it is, to be sure!” cried
Plunk to himself. “What I catch in the morning
I eat up at night, and there’s no joy for me in
this world at all, at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And then Plunk heard that there were also rich
sheriffs in the land, and men of great power and
might, who lived in luxury and comfort, lapped in
gold and fed on truffles. Then Plunk fell a-thinking
how he too might come to look upon such riches
and live in the midst of them. So he made up his
mind that for three whole days he would sit still
in his boat on the sea and not take any fish at all,
but see if that spell would help him.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Plunk sat for three days and nights in his
boat on the face of the sea—three days he sat there,
three days he fasted, for three days he caught no
fish. When the third day began to dawn, lo and
behold, a silver boat arose from the sea—a silver
boat with golden oars—and in the boat, fair as a
king’s daughter, stood the Pale Dawn-Maiden.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For three days you have spared my little
fishes’ lives,” said the Dawn-Maiden, “and now
tell me what you would like me to do for you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Help me out of this miserable and dreary
life. Here am I all day long slaving away in this
desolate place. What I catch during the day I eat
up at night, and there is no joy for me in the world
at all, at all,” said Plunk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go home,” said the Dawn-Maiden, “and you
will find what you need.” And as she spoke, she
sank in the sea, silver boat and all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Plunk hurried back to the shore and then home.
When he came to the house, a poor orphan girl
came out to meet him, all weary with the long
tramp across the hills. The girl said: “My mother
is dead, and I am all alone in the world. Take me
for your wife, Plunk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Plunk hardly knew what to do. “Is this the
good fortune which the Dawn-Maiden has sent me?”
Plunk could see that the girl was just a poor body
like himself; on the other hand, he was afraid of
making a mistake and turning away his luck. So
he consented, and took the poor girl to be his wife;
and she, being very tired, lay down and slept till
the morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Plunk could scarcely await the next day for
wondering how his good fortune would show itself.
But nothing happened that day except that Plunk
took his hook and went out fishing, and the Woman
went up the hill to gather wild spinach. Plunk came
home at night, and so did the Woman, and they
supped upon fish and wild spinach. “Eh, if that is
all the good luck there is to it, I could just as well
have done without,” thought Plunk.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the evening wore on, the Woman sat down
beside Plunk to tell him stories, to wile away the
time for him. She told him about nabobs and kings’
castles, about dragons that watch treasure-hoards,
and kings’ daughters who sow their gardens with
pearls and reap gems. Plunk listened, and his heart
within him began to sing for joy. Plunk forgot that
he was poor; he could have sat and listened to her
for three years together. But Plunk was still better
pleased when he considered: “She is a fairy wife.
She can show me the way to the dragons’ hoards
or the kings’ gardens. I need only be patient and
not make her angry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Plunk waited; and day after day went by,
a year went by, two years passed. A little son was
born to them; they called him little Winpeace. Yet
all went on as usual. Plunk caught fish, and his
wife gathered wild spinach in the mountains. In
the evening she cooked the supper, and after supper
she rocked the baby and told Plunk stories. Her
stories grew prettier and prettier, and Plunk found
it harder and harder to wait, till at last, one evening,
he had had enough of it; and just as his wife was
telling him about the immense treasures of the Sea
King, Plunk jumped up in a rage, shook her by the
arm and cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tell you I’ll wait no longer. To-morrow in
the morning you shall take me down to the Sea
King’s Castle!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Woman was quite frightened when Plunk
jumped up like that. She told him that she did not
know where the Sea King had his Castle; but
Plunk began to beat his poor wife most unmercifully,
and threatened to kill her unless she told him
her fairy secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the poor girl understood that Plunk had
taken her for a fairy. She burst into tears and cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Truly I am no fairy, but a poor orphan girl
who knows no spells nor magic. And for the tales
I have told you, I had them from my own heart to
beguile your weariness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now this only put Plunk all the more in a rage,
because he had lived in a fool’s paradise for over
two years; and he angrily bade the Woman go
away next morning ere dawn with the child, along
the sea-shore to the right-hand side, and he, Plunk,
would go to the left, and she was not to come back
again till she had found the way to the Sea King’s
Castle.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the dawn came, the Woman wept and
begged Plunk not to send her away. “Who knows
where one of us may be destroyed on this desolate
sea-shore?” said she. But Plunk fell upon her again,
so that she took up her child and went away crying
whither her husband had bidden her. And Plunk
went off in the opposite direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the Woman went on with her baby, little
Winpeace. She went on for a week; she went on
for a fortnight, and nowhere did she find the way to
the Sea King. She grew so terribly tired that one
day she fell asleep on a stone beside the sea. When
she woke up, her baby was gone—her little Winpeace.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her grief was so great that the tears froze fast
in her heart, and not a word could she speak for
sorrow, but became dumb from that hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the poor dumb creature wandered back along
the sea-shore and home. And next day Plunk came
home, too. He had not found the way to the Sea
King, and he came back disappointed and cross.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he got home, there was no baby Winpeace,
and his wife had gone dumb. She could
not tell him what had happened, but was all haggard
with the great trouble.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so it was with them from that day forward.
The Woman neither wept nor complained, but did
her housework and waited upon Plunk in silence;
and the house was still and quiet as the grave. For
some time Plunk stood it, but in the end he got
thoroughly weary. He had just felt almost sure of
the Sea King’s treasure, and lo! all this trouble
and worry had come upon him.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Plunk made up his mind to try his sea-spell
once more. Again for three whole days he sat in
his boat on the sea, for three days he fasted, for
three days he caught no fish. At the third day, at
daybreak, the Dawn-Maiden arose before him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Plunk told her what had happened, and complained
bitterly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m worse off than ever before. The baby is
gone, the wife is dumb, and my house dreary as
the grave, and I’m just about bursting with trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To this the Dawn-Maiden said never a word,
but just asked Plunk a question:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you want? I will help you just this
once more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Plunk was such a zany that he couldn’t
think of anything else but just this, that he was set
on seeing and enjoying the Sea King’s treasure;
and so he didn’t wish for his child back again, or
that his wife should regain the power of speech,
but he begged the Dawn-Maiden:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fair Dawn-Maiden,” said he, “show me the
way to the Sea King.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And again the Dawn-Maiden said nothing, but
very kindly set Plunk on his way:</p>

<p class='c009'>“When day dawns at the next New Moon, get
into your boat, wait for the wind, and then drift
eastward with the wind. The wind will carry you
to the Isle Bountiful, to the stone Gold-a-Fire. And
there I shall be waiting for you to show you the way
to the Sea King.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Plunk went joyfully home.</p>

<p class='c009'>When it was about the New Moon (but he
never told his wife anything) he went out at the
streak of dawn, got into his boat, waited for the wind,
and let the wind carry him away toward the east.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/i064a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>The wind caught the boat and carried it along
to the Unknown Sea, to the Isle Bountiful. Like
a green garden the fruitful island floats upon the
sea. The grass grows rank, and the meadows
lush, the vines are full of grapes and the almondtrees
pink with blossom. In the midst of the island
there is precious stone, the white blazing stone
Gold-a-Fire. One half of the stone sheds its glow
upon the island, and the other half lights up the
sea under the island. And there on the Isle Bountiful,
on the stone Gold-a-Fire, sits the Dawn-Maiden.</p>

<p class='c009'>Very kindly did the Dawn-Maiden receive Plunk,
very kindly she set him on his way. She showed
him a mill-wheel drifting on the sea towards the
island, and the mermaids dancing in a ring around
the wheel. Then she told him—always very kindly—how
he must ask the mill-wheel politely to take him
down to the Sea King and not let the Dark Deeps
of the Sea swallow him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Last of all the Dawn-Maiden said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great store of gold and treasure will you enjoy
in the Sea King’s domain. But mark—to earth you
cannot return, for three terrible watchers bar the
way. One troubles the waves, the second raises
the storm, and the third wields the lightning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Plunk was happy as a grig in his boat as
he paddled towards the mill-wheel, and thought to
himself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s easy to see, fair Dawn-Maiden, that you’ve
never known want in this world. I shan’t hanker
back after this earth, where I’m leaving nothing but
ill-luck behind!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So he paddled up to the mill-wheel, where
round the mill-wheel the mermaids were playing
their foolish games. They dived and chased each
other through the water; their long hair floated
on the waves, their silver fins glittered, and their
red lips smiled. And they sat on the mill-wheel
and made the sea all foamy around it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boat reached the mill-wheel, and Plunk did
as the Dawn-Maiden had told him. He held his
paddle aloft so that the Dark Deeps should not
swallow him, and he politely asked the mill-wheel:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Round wheel giddy-go-round, please take me
down, either to the Dead Dark Deep or to the Sea
King’s Palace.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Plunk said this, the mermaids came swishing
along like so many silver fish, swarmed round the
mill-wheel, seized the spokes in their snowy hands,
and began to turn the wheel—swiftly, giddily.</p>

<p class='c009'>An eddy formed in the sea—a fierce eddy, a
terrible whirlpool. The whirlpool caught Plunk;
it swept him round like a twig, and sucked him
down to the Sea King’s fastness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Plunk’s ears were still ringing with the swirl
of the sea and the mermaids’ silly laughter when he
suddenly found himself sitting on beautiful sand—fine
sand of pure gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>Plunk looked round and cried out: “Ho, there’s
a wonder for you! A whole field of golden sand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now what Plunk had taken to be a big field
was only the great Hall of the Sea King. Round the
Hall stood the sea like a marble wall, and above the
Hall hung the sea, like a glass dome. Down from the
stone Gold-a-Fire streamed a bluish glare, livid and
pale as moonlight. From the ceiling hung festoons
of pearls, and on the floor below stood tables of
coral.</p>

<p class='c009'>And at the end—the far end, where slender pipes
were piping and tiny bells tinkling—there lazed and
lounged the Sea King himself; he stretched his
limbs on the golden sand, raising only his great
bullock’s head, beside him a coral table, and behind
him a golden hedge.</p>

<p class='c009'>What with the quick, shrill music of the pipes,
the tinkling of the bells, and the sheen and glimmer
all around him, Plunk wouldn’t have believed there
could be so much pleasure or wealth in the world!</p>

<p class='c009'>Plunk went clean mad for pure joy—joy went
to his head like strong wine; his heart sang; he
clapped his hands; he skipped about the golden
sand like a frolicsome child; he turned head over
heels once, twice, and again—just like a jolly boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now this amused the Sea King vastly. For
the Sea King’s feet are heavy—far too heavy—and
his great bullock’s head is heavier still. The Sea
King guffawed as he lounged on the golden sand;
he laughed so heartily that the golden sand blew
up all round him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re fine and light on your feet, my boy,”
said the Sea King, and he reached up and pulled
down a branch of pearls and gave it to Plunk. And
then the Sea King ordered the Under Seas Fairies
to bring choice viands and honeyed drink in golden
vessels. And Plunk had leave to sit beside the Sea
King at the coral table, and surely that was a great
honour!</p>

<p class='c009'>When Plunk had dined, the Sea King asked him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there anything else you would like, my
man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now what should a poor man ask for, who had
never known what it is to have a good time? But
Plunk was hungry from his long journey, and he
had made but a poor meal of it off the choice viands
and the honeyed drinks. So he said to the Sea
King:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as you were saying that, O King of the
Sea, I was wishing that I had a good helping of boiled
wild spinach.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Sea King was rather surprised, but he
recovered himself quickly, laughed and said to
Plunk:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh, brother of mine, wild spinach is very dear
down here, dearer than pearls and mother-o’-pearl,
because it’s a long way from here to the place where
it grows. But since you have just asked for it, I will
send a Foam Fairy to bring you some from the
land where the wild spinach grows. But you must
turn three more coach-wheels for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Plunk was already in the best of humours
he didn’t find that hard either. Lightly he leapt
to his feet, and quickly they all flocked round him,
the mermaids and the tiny folk in the Palace, and
all for to see that wonder!</p>

<p class='c009'>Plunk took a run over the golden sand, turned
a beautiful coach-wheel, then a second and a third,
light as a squirrel, and the Sea King and all the
tiny folk rocked with laughter at such cunning.</p>

<p class='c009'>But heartiest of all laughed a little baby, and
that was the little King whom the mermaids themselves
had crowned King for fun and idle sport.
The wee baby was sitting up in a golden cradle.
His little shirt was of silk, the cradle was hung with
tiny bells of pearl, and in his hands the child held
a golden apple.</p>

<p class='c009'>While Plunk was turning coach-wheels and the
little King laughed so heartily, Plunk looked round
at him. He looked at the little King, and then—Plunk
started. It was his own baby boy, little Winpeace.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, Plunk was suddenly disgusted. He would
never have guessed that he would grow sick of it
so soon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Plunk frowned; he was angry, and when he
had got over his shock a bit he thought:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at him, the urchin, how he’s got on,
lording it here in idleness and sport, and his mother
at home gone dumb with grieving!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Plunk was vexed; he hated seeing himself or
the child in this Palace; yet he dared not say a
word, lest they should part him from the boy. So
he made himself the servant of his son, of little
Winpeace, and thought to himself: “Perhaps I
shall be left alone with him sometimes. Then I will
remind the boy of his Father and Mother; I will
run away with him; I will carry off the little brat
and go back with him to his mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So thought Plunk, and one fine day, when he
happened to be alone with the little King, he
whispered to the child: “Come along, my boy;
let’s run away with father.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Winpeace was only a baby, and what with
living so long under the sea, he had quite forgotten
his father. He laughed; the little King laughed.
He thought: “Plunk is making fun,” and he kicked
Plunk with his little foot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are not my father; you are the silly-billy
who turns head over heels before the Sea King.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That stung Plunk to the heart, so that he well-nigh
died with the pain of it. He went out and wept
for sheer bitter sorrow. All the Sea King’s attendants
gathered round him and said one to the other:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well, he must have been a great lord
on earth, to weep amid such splendours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Upon my soul,” cried Plunk wrathfully, “I
was the same as your Sea King here. I had a
son who tugged my beard, a wife who showed me
marvels, and wild spinach, brothers, as much as
you want—and no need to turn coach-wheels before
anybody either.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id009'>
<img src='images/i072a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>The sea-folk marvelled at such magnificence, and
left Plunk to mourn his lost greatness. But Plunk
went on serving the little King. He did all he could
to please the boy, thinking: “I shall get him
somehow to run away with me.” But the little King
grew sillier and more wayward every day; the days
passed, and every day the child only thought Plunk
more than ever a zany.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>II</h3>

<p class='c011'>Now all this time Plunk’s wife was at home,
all alone and grieving. The first evening she made
up the fire and kept the supper hot for Plunk;
but when she gave up expecting Plunk, she let the
fire go out, nor did she kindle it again.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the poor dumb soul sat on her threshold. She
neither worked, nor tidied, nor wept, nor lamented,
but just pined away with grief and sorrow. She
could not take counsel with anyone, because she was
dumb; nor could she cross the sea after Plunk,
because she was all broken up with grieving.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where could she go, poor soul! but back one
day to the far hills, where her mother lay buried.
And as she stood by her mother’s grave a beautiful
Hind up came to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>And as the dumb animals speak, so the Hind
spoke to the Woman:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must not sit there and pine away, my
daughter, for else your heart will break and your
house will perish. But every evening you must get
Plunk’s supper ready for him, and after supper you
must unpick some fine hemp. If Plunk does not
come home, then you must take his supper in the
morning and the fine hemp as well, and also the
slender twin pipes, and go up into the rocky
mountain. Play upon the twin pipes; the snakes
and their young will come and eat up the supper,
and the sea-fowl will line their nests with the hemp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Full well the daughter understood all that her
mother said, and as she was bid so did she do.
Every evening she cooked supper, and after supper
she unpicked hemp. Plunk did not come back;
and so the Woman took her little twin pipes in the
morning, and carried both supper and hemp to the
rocky mountain. And as she played on her little
pipes, played softly on the right-hand pipe, lo,
snakes and baby snakes came out of the rocks. They
ate up the supper and thanked the Woman in the
dumb speech. And when she played on the left-hand
pipe, lo, gulls great and small came flying,
carried off the hemp to their nests, and thanked the
Woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>For three months the Woman went on in this
way; thrice the moon waxed and waned, and still
Plunk had not come home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again grief overcame the poor dumb soul, so
that she went again to her mother’s grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Hind came up, and in dumb speech the
Woman said to her:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Mother, I have done all you told me,
and Plunk has not come back. I am weary of waiting.
Shall I throw myself into the sea, or fling myself
down from the cliffs?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Daughter of mine,” said the Hind, “you must
not fail in your trust. Your Plunk is in grievous
trouble. Now listen and hear how you may help
him. In the Unknown Sea there is a Big Bass, and
that Bass has a golden fin, and on that fin grows
a golden apple. If you catch that Bass by moonlight
you will deliver your dear Plunk from his
trouble. But on the road to the Unknown Sea you
will have to pass three caverns of cloud. In the
first there is a monstrous Snake, the Mother of All
Snakes—it is she who troubles the sea and stirs
up the waves; in the second there is a monstrous
Bird, the Mother of All Birds—it is she who raises
the storm; and in the third there is a Golden Bee—it
is she who flashes and wields the lightning.
Go, daughter dear, to the Unknown Sea, and take
nothing with you but your bone hook and slender
twin pipes, and if you should find yourself in great
trouble, rip open your right-hand sleeve, all white
and unhemmed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The daughter gave good heed. Next day she
took out the boat and put off to sea, taking nothing
with her but her hook and the slender twin pipes.</p>

<p class='c009'>She drifted and sailed on the face of the sea
till the waters bore her to a far-off place, and there
on the sea, lo, three terrible caverns of lowering
cloud!</p>

<p class='c009'>From the entrance of the first cavern peered
the head of a fearsome Snake, the Mother of All
Snakes. Her grisly head blocked up all the entrance,
her body lay coiled along the cave, and with her
monstrous tail she lashed the sea, troubling the
waters and stirring up the waves.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Woman did not dare go near the terrible
sight, but remembered her little pipes, and began
to play upon the right-hand pipe. And as she
played, there came from the far-off, rock-bound
lands snakes and baby snakes galore swimming over
the sea. Great coloured snakes and tiny little snakes
all came hurrying up and scurrying up and begged
the fearsome Snake—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the Woman take her boat through your
cavern, Mother dear! She has done us a great
good turn and fed us every day in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Through my cavern I may not let her pass,”
answered the fearsome Snake, “for to-day I must
stir up the waves of the sea. But if she did you
such a good turn, I will repay it with another.
Would she rather have a bar of gold or six strings
of pearls?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But a true wife is not to be beguiled with gold
or pearls, and so the Woman answered in dumb
speech:</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Tis only for a small matter I have come here—for
the Bass that lives in the Unknown Sea. If I
have done you a good turn, let me pass through
your cavern, fearsome Snake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let her pass, Mother dear,” said the snakes
and baby snakes again. “Here are many of us whom
she has fed—full many to whom she gave meat.
You just lie down, Mother dear, and take a nap,
and we’ll stir up the waters for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the Snake couldn’t very well disoblige
such a big family, and she had been longing for
sleep for a thousand years. So she let the Woman
through the cavern, and then curled up on the floor
of the cavern and fell into a fearsome sleep. But
before she fell asleep she reminded the snakes and
baby snakes once more:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, stir me up the waters right properly,
children dear, while I rest a little.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So the Woman passed through the cavern, and
the snakes and their young stayed in the cavern;
but instead of stirring up the sea they soothed it
and made it calm.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Woman sailed on, and came to the second
cavern. And in the second cavern there was a
monstrous Bird, the Mother of All Birds. She
craned her frightful head through the opening, her
iron beak gaped wide; she spread her vast wings in
the cavern and flapped them, and whenever she
flapped her wings she raised a storm.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id010'>
<img src='images/i079.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Woman took up her twin pipes and sweetly
played upon the left-hand pipe. And from the far
shore came flying gulls great and small, and begged
the monstrous bird to let the Woman pass with her
boat through her cavern, for that she had been a
good friend to them and unpicked hemp for them
every day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t let her pass through my cavern, for
to-day I must raise a mighty storm. But if she was
so kind to you, I will repay her with even greater
kindness. From my iron beak I will give her of the
Water of Life, so that the power of speech shall be
restored to her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, and wasn’t it a sore temptation for the
poor dumb creature who desired above all things
that the power of speech should return to her?
But she remained steadfast, and this is what she
answered the Bird:</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Tis not for my own good that I came, but
for a small matter—for the Bass that lives in the
Unknown Sea. If I have done you a good turn,
let me pass through your cavern.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the grey gulls all entreated the Mother
Bird and also advised her to take a little nap, and
they would meanwhile raise the storm for her. The
Mother Bird listened to her children’s entreaty,
clung to the wall of the cavern with her iron talons
and went to sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the gulls great and small, instead of raising
the storm, calmed the wild winds and soothed them.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the dumb Woman sailed through the second
cavern and came to the third.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the third cavern she found the Golden Bee.
The Golden Bee buzzed in the entrance; she wielded
the fiery lightning and the rolling thunder. Sea and
cavern resounded; lightnings flashed from the
clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fear seized upon the Woman when she found
herself all alone with these terrors. But she remembered
her right sleeve; she ripped it off, her
sleeve all white and unhemmed, flung it over the
Golden Bee and caught her in the sleeve!</p>

<p class='c009'>The thunder and lightning were stilled at once,
and the Golden Bee began to coax the Woman:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Set me free, O Woman! and in return I
will show you something. Look out over the wide
waters, and it’s a joyful sight you will see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Woman looked out over the wide waters.
The sun was just on the horizon. The sky grew
pink overhead; the sea grew crimson from the east,
and from the sea arose a silver boat. And in the
boat sat the Dawn-Maiden, pale and fair as a king’s
daughter, and beside her a little child in a silken
shirt and with a golden apple in his hand. It was
the Dawn-Maiden taking the little King for his
morning sail on the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Woman recognised her lost baby.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now isn’t that a wonder of wonders, that the
sea should be so wide that a mother cannot encompass
it, and the sun so high that a mother should not
be able to reach it?</p>

<p class='c009'>Her joy took hold of her like terror. She
trembled like the slender aspen. Should she stretch
out her hand to the child? or call to him tenderly?
or should she just stand and look at him for ever
and ever?</p>

<p class='c009'>The silver boat glided over the crimson sea.
It faded away in the distance; the boat sank under
the waves, and the mother roused herself with a
start.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will show you,” said the Golden Bee to
the Woman, “how to get to the little King, your
son, and live with him in joy and happiness. But
first set me free, that I may wield the lightnings
in the cavern—and through my cavern I cannot
let you pass!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A fierce pang overcame the poor mother, overwhelmed
and shook her. She had seen her darling;
her eyes had beheld her heart’s desire; she had
seen and beheld him, but not hugged him, not
kissed him! The pang shook her from head to foot.
Should she be true to Plunk or no? Should she let
the Bee go and win to her child, or pass through
the cavern to the Unknown Sea for the sake of the
Big Bass?</p>

<p class='c009'>But even as the pang shot through the Woman,
the tears gushed forth from her heart; the power
of speech returned to her, and ’twas in living words
that she answered the Golden Bee:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t sting me, O Golden Bee! I shall not
let you go, because I must pass through your
cavern. I have wept for my child and buried him
in my heart. I have not come here for my own
happiness, but for a small matter—for the Big Bass
that lives in the Unknown Sea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus said the Woman, and passed into the
cavern. She rested in the cavern; she took her ease
in the boat, and there she waited for nightfall and
moonrise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eh, my dearie, but the sea was quiet that day,
with the winds at rest in the sky, and the fearsome
Snake asleep in the first cavern, and the monstrous
Bird asleep in the second, and the wearied Woman
in the third!</p>

<p class='c009'>So the day went quietly by; evening came,
and the moon rose. When the moon rode high in
the heavens, the Woman sailed out upon the Unknown
Sea at midnight, and in the midst of the
Sea she let down her little bone hook.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>III</h3>

<p class='c011'>That very evening the little King bade Plunk
knit him a nice set of silken reins. “First thing
to-morrow morning I shall harness you to my little
carriage, and you shall give me a ride on the golden
sands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dearie me, considered poor Plunk, and where
was he to hide from the Dawn-Maiden when she
would go down into the sea in the morning and
behold him thus to-morrow harnessed to a cart
by his own son?</p>

<p class='c009'>All the Sea King’s court slept. The Sea King
slept. The wilful little King slept—only Plunk was
awake and knitting away at the reins. He knitted
fiercely, like one who is thinking hard. When it
seemed to him that the strings were strong enough,
Plunk said to himself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never asked anyone’s counsel when I was
making a fool of myself, nor shall I do so now
that I have come to my senses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And as he said this he went softly up to the
cradle where his son lay fast asleep, wound the
reins round and round the rockers of the cradle,
lashed the cradle to his own back, and started to
run away with his son.</p>

<p class='c009'>Softly Plunk strode over the golden sand—strode
through the mighty Hall, spacious as a wide
meadow; slipped through the golden hedge, parting
the branches of pearls; and when he came to where
the sea stood up like a wall, nothing daunted, Plunk
dived into the water with his boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it is far—terribly far—from the Sea King’s
fastness to the world of day above! Plunk swam
and swam; but how was a poor fisherman to swim
when he was weighed down by the little King—golden
cradle, golden apple and all—on his back?</p>

<p class='c009'>Plunk felt as if the sea was piling itself up above
him, higher and higher, and heavier and heavier!</p>

<p class='c009'>And just as Plunk was at the last gasp, he felt
something scrape along the golden cradle, something
that caught in the rocker of the cradle; and when
it had caught fast, it began to haul them along
apace!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now it’s all up with me!” said poor Plunk
to himself. “Here’s a sea-monster carrying me away
on his tusk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But it wasn’t the tusk of a sea-monster; it was
a bone fish-hook, the very hook that Plunk’s wife
had let down.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the Woman felt that her hook had caught,
she joyfully summoned all her strength, pulling and
hauling with all her might, for fear of losing the
great Big Bass.</p>

<p class='c009'>As she began to haul in her catch the golden
rocker began to show above the water. The Woman
could not distinguish it rightly by moonlight, but
thought: “It is the golden fin of the Bass.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Next came up the child with the golden apple.
Again the Woman thought: “It is the golden apple
on the fish’s fin.” And when at last Plunk’s head
came up, the Woman cried out joyfully: “And
here is the head of the great Big Bass.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And as she cried out she hauled in her catch,
and when she had hauled it close alongside—why,
dearie mine, how am I to tell you rightly how
overjoyed were those three when they met again in
the boat, all in the moonlight, in the middle of the
Unknown Sea?</p>

<p class='c009'>But they dare not lose any time. They had to
pass through the three caverns ere the monstrous
watchers should awaken. So they took out the oars
and rowed with all their might and main.</p>

<p class='c009'>But oh dear! the bad luck they had! When
the little King awoke and saw his mummy, he remembered
her at once. He threw both his little
arms round his mummy’s neck—and the golden
apple fell out of his hand. Down fell the apple into
the sea, down to the very bottom and into the Sea
King’s Castle, and hit the Sea King right on his
shoulder!</p>

<p class='c009'>The Sea King woke up, and bellowed with rage.
All the court jumped to their feet. They saw at once
that the little King and his servant were missing!</p>

<p class='c009'>They gave chase. The mermaids swam out
under the moonlight; the light foam fairies flew
out over the water; runners were sent out to rouse
the watchers in the caverns.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the boat had already passed through the
caverns, and so they had to pursue it farther on.
Plunk and the Woman were rowing—rowing for
dear life, their pursuers close in their wake. The
mermaids whipped up the waters; the swift foam
fairies darted after the boat; the angry waves rose
up in wrath behind them; the wind howled from the
clouds. Nearer and nearer came the pursuers.
The finest ship afloat would not have had a chance,
and how could a tiny two-oared boat? For hours
and hours the boat flew on before the tempest, and
just as the day began to break, lo, terror gathered
from all sides around the boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the hurricane beat upon the boat; the
crested billows towered above it; the mermaids
joined in a ring around it. The ring heaved and
swayed around the boat; the mermaids raised their
linked hands high to let the mountainous waves
pass through, but never let the little craft escape
the waves. Sea and storm whistled and roared.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fear of death was upon Plunk, and in his
dire need he cried out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, fair Dawn-Maiden, help!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Dawn-Maiden arose from the sea. She
saw Plunk, but never looked at him. She looked at
the little King, but no gift had she for him; but
to the faithful Wife she swiftly gave her gift—a
broidered kerchief and a pin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Quickly they hoisted the kerchief, and it became
a white sail, and the pin turned into a rudder. The
wind filled the sail, so that it bulged like a ripe
apple, and the Woman gripped the rudder with a
strong hand. The mermaids’ ring round the boat
was broken; the boat rode upon the azure sea like a
star across the blue heavens! A wonder of wonders,
it flew over the sea before its terrible pursuers;
the fiercer the pursuit, the greater help it was to
them; for the swifter the wind blew, the more
swiftly yet flew the boat before the wind, and the
swifter the sea, the more swiftly rode the boat
upon the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Already the rock-bound shore loomed afar, and
upon the shore Plunk’s little cottage and the bar
of white sand before it.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the land hove in sight, the pursuit
slackened. The foam fairies fear the shore; the
mermaids keep away from the coast. Wind and
waves stayed on the high seas, and only the boat
flew straight ahead to land like a child to its mother’s
lap.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boat flew to land over the white sand bar,
and struck on a rock. The boat split on the rock.
Down went sail and rudder; down went the golden
cradle; away flew the Golden-winged Bee; and
Plunk and his wife and child were left alone on the
beach outside their cottage.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they sat down that night to their supper
of wild spinach, they had clean forgotten all that
had happened. And but for those twin pipes, there’s
not a soul would remember it now. But whoever
starts to play on the pipes, the fat pipe at once begins
to drone out about Plunk:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Harum-scarum Plunk would go</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the pearls and corals grow;</div>
      <div class='line'>There he found but grief and woe.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And then the little pipe reminds us of the Woman:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Rise, O Dawn, in loveliness!</div>
      <div class='line'>Here is new-born happiness;</div>
      <div class='line'>Were it three times drown’d in ill.</div>
      <div class='line'>Faith and Love would save it still!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And that is the twin pipes’ message to the wide,
wide world.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c012'>ONCE upon a beautiful summer night the
men were watching their horses in the
meadow. And as they watched, they fell
asleep. And as they slept, the fairies
flew out of the clouds to have some sport with the
horses, as is the fairies’ way. Each fairy caught a
horse, mounted it, and then whipped it with her
golden hair, urging it round and round the dewy
meadow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the fairies there was one quite young and
tiny, called Curlylocks, who had come down to earth
from the clouds for the first time that night.</p>

<p class='c009'>Curlylocks thought it lovely to ride through
the night like a whirlwind. And it so happened that
she had got hold of the most spirited horse of all—a
Black—small, but fierce as fire. The Black galloped
round and round with the other horses, but he was
the swiftest of all. Soon he was all in a lather of
foam.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Curlylocks wanted to ride faster still. She
bent down and pinched the Black’s right ear. The
horse started, reared, and then bolted straight ahead,
leaving behind the rest of the horses, the meadow
and all, as he flew away like the wind with Curlylocks
into the wide, wide world.</p>

<p class='c009'>Curlylocks thoroughly enjoyed her lightning
ride. The Black went like the wind, by field and
by river, by meadow and mountain, over dale and
hill. “Good gracious! what a lot of things there
are in the world!” thought Curlylocks, full of delight
as she looked at all the pretty sights. But what
pleased her best was when they came through a
country where there were mountains all covered
with glorious forests, and at the foot of the mountains
two golden fields like two great gold kerchiefs,
and in the midst of them two white villages, like
two white doves, and a little further on a great sheet
of water.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id010'>
<img src='images/i096a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>But the Black would not stop, neither there
nor anywhere, but rushed on and on as if he were
possessed.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the Black carried Curlylocks far and far
away till at last they came to a great plain, with a
cold wind blowing over it. The Black galloped
into the plain, and there was nothing there but
yellow sand, neither trees nor grass, and the further
they went into that great waste, the colder it grew.
But how large that plain is, I cannot tell you, for
the good reason that the man does not live who
could cross it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Black ran on with Curlylocks for seven
days and seven nights. The seventh day, just before
sunrise, they reached the centre of the plain, and
in the centre of the plain they found the ruinous
walls of the terribly great city of Frosten, and there
it is always bitterly cold.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the Black raced up to the ancient gates of
Frosten, Curlylocks threw her magic veil on the
wall, and so caught hold of the wall. The Black
galloped away from under her, and so continued
his wild career up to his old age to and fro between
the huge walls of Frosten, till at last he found the
northern gate and galloped out again into the plain—God
knows whither!</p>

<p class='c009'>But Curlylocks came down from the wall and
began to walk about the city, and it was cold as
cold! Her magic veil, without which she could not
fly among the clouds, she wound about her shoulders,
for she took great care of it. And so Curlylocks
walked and walked about the city of Frosten, and
all the time she felt as if she must come upon something
very wonderful in this city, which was so
marvellous and so great. However, nothing did she
see but only great crumbling walls, and nothing did
she hear but now and again a stone cracking with
the cold.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly, just as Curlylocks had turned the
corner of the very biggest wall, she saw, fast asleep
at the foot of the wall, a huge man, bigger than the
biggest oak in the biggest forest. The man was
dressed in a huge cloak of coarse linen, and the
strap he wore for a belt was five fathoms long.
His head was as big as the biggest barrel, and his
beard was like a shock of corn. He was so big, that
man, you might have thought there was a church
tower fallen down beside the wall!</p>

<p class='c009'>This giant was called Reygoch, and he lived
at Frosten. All he did was to count the stones of
the city of Frosten. He could never have finished
counting them but for that huge head of his, as
big as a barrel. But he counted and counted—he
had counted for a thousand years, and had already
counted thirty walls and five gates of the city.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Curlylocks spied Reygoch, she clasped
her hands and wondered. She never thought there
could be such an immense creature in the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Curlylocks sat down by Reygoch’s ear (and
Reygoch’s ear was as big as the whole of Curlylocks),
and called down his ear:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aren’t you cold, daddy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reygoch woke up, laughed, and looked at
Curlylocks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cold? I should think I was cold,” answered
Reygoch, and his voice was as deep as distant
thunder. Reygoch’s big nose was all red with the
cold, and his hair and beard were all thick with
hoar-frost.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me!” said Curlylocks, “you’re such a
big man, and you aren’t going to build yourself a
roof to keep out the cold?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why should I?” said Reygoch, and laughed
again. “The sun will be out presently.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reygoch heaved himself up so as to sit. He
sat up. He clapped his left shoulder with his right
hand, and his right shoulder he clapped with the
left hand, so as to beat out the hoar-frost; and the
hoar-frost came off each shoulder as if it were snow
slipping off a roof!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look out! look out, daddy! you’ll smother
me!” cried Curlylocks. But Reygoch could scarcely
hear her, because it was a long way from Curlylocks
to his ear, so big was he when he sat up.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Reygoch lifted Curlylocks on to his shoulder,
told her his name and his business, and she told
him how she had come.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And here comes the sun,” said Reygoch, and
pointed for Curlylocks to see.</p>

<p class='c009'>Curlylocks looked, and there was the sun rising,
but so pale and feeble, as if there were no one for
him to warm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you are a silly, Reygoch!” said Curlylocks—“you
are really silly to live here and spend
your life counting these tiresome stones of Frosten.
Come along, Reygoch, and see how beautiful the
world is, and find something more sensible to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now it had never occurred to Reygoch to want
a finer home for himself than Frosten city, nor had
he ever thought that there might be better work
than his in the world. Reygoch always thought,
“I was meant to count the stones of Frosten,” and
had never asked for anything better.</p>

<p class='c009'>Curlylocks, however, gave him no peace, but
persuaded him to come out and see the world
with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll take you to a lovely country,” said Curlylocks,
“where there is an ancient forest, and beside
the forest two golden fields.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Curlylocks talked for a long time. And old
Reygoch had never had anybody to talk to, and so
he couldn’t resist persuasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, let’s go!” said he.</p>

<p class='c009'>Curlylocks was mightily pleased with this.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now they had to contrive something, so that
Reygoch could carry Curlylocks, because Reygoch
himself had nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Curlylocks drew out from her bosom a little
bag of pearls. It was her mother who had given
Curlylocks these pearls before allowing her to go
down to earth, and told her: “If you ever should
need anything, just throw down a pearl, and it will
turn into whatever you want. Be very careful of
those pearls, because there are so many things in
the world that you will want more and more as you
go on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Curlylocks took out a tiny seed-pearl, threw it
down, and lo, before their eyes there grew a little
basket, just as big as Curlylocks, and the basket had
a loop attached, just big enough to fit Reygoch’s
ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>Curlylocks jumped into the basket; and Reygoch
picked up the basket and hung it on his ear like an
ear-ring!</p>

<p class='c009'>Whenever Reygoch laughed, whenever he sneezed
or shook his head, Curlylocks rocked as if she were
in a swing; and she thought it a capital way of
travelling.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Reygoch started to walk, and had already
taken a ten-yard stride, when Curlylocks stopped
him, and begged:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Couldn’t we go underground, perhaps, Reygoch
dear, so that I might see what there is under the
earth?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not?” answered Reygoch; for he could
break into the earth as easy as fun, only it had never
entered his head to look what might be underground.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Curlylocks wanted to know everything about
everything, and so they agreed to travel underground
until they should arrive under the forest
by the golden fields, and there they would come up.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they had settled that, Reygoch began to
break up the earth. He lifted up his great feet and
stamped for the first time, and at that the whole
of the great city of Frosten shook and a great many
walls tumbled down. Reygoch raised his feet a
second time and stamped again, and the whole
plain quaked. Reygoch raised his feet a third time
and stamped, and lo, half the world trembled, the
solid earth gaped under Reygoch, and Reygoch and
Curlylocks fell into the hole and down under the
earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they got there, they found the earth all
honeycombed with pillars and passages on every side,
and heaven alone knew where they all led to. And
they could hear waters rushing and the moaning of
the winds.</p>

<p class='c009'>They followed one of the passages, and for
awhile they had light from the hole through which
they had fallen. But as they went on it grew darker
and darker—black darkness, such as there is nowhere
save in the bowels of the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reygoch tramped calmly on in the dark. With
his great hands he felt his way from pillar to pillar.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Curlylocks was frightened by the great
darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>She clung to Reygoch’s ear and cried: “It’s
dark, Reygoch dear!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, and why not?” returned Reygoch. “The
dark didn’t come to us. It’s we have come to it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Curlylocks got cross, because Reygoch
never minded anything and she had expected great
things from so huge a man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should be in a nice fix with you but for my
pearls,” said Curlylocks quite angrily.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she threw down another pearl, and a tiny
lantern grew in her hand, bright as if it were lit
with gold. The darkness crept back deeper into
the earth, and the light shone far through the
underground passages.</p>

<p class='c009'>Curlylocks was delighted with her lantern,
because it showed up all the marvels which had been
swallowed by the earth in days of old. In one place
she saw lordly castles, with doors and windows all
fretted with gold and framed in red marble. In
another place were warriors’ weapons, slender-barrelled
muskets and heavy scimitars studded with
gems and precious stones. In a third place she saw
long-buried treasures, golden dishes and silver
goblets full of gold ducats, and the Emperor’s very
crown of gold three times refined. All these treasures
had been swallowed up by God’s will, and it is
God’s secret why so much treasure should lie
there undisturbed.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id011'>
<img src='images/i106.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>But Curlylocks was quite dazzled with all these
marvels; and instead of going straight ahead by
the way they had settled upon, she begged Reygoch
to put her down so that she might play about a little
and admire all the strange things and gaze upon the
wonders of God’s secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Reygoch set Curlylocks down, and Curlylocks
took her little lantern and ran to the castles,
and to the weapons, and to the treasure-hoards.
And lest she might lose her little bag of pearls while
she was playing, she laid it down beside a pillar.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Reygoch, he sat down to rest not far off.</p>

<p class='c009'>Curlylocks began to play with the treasures;
she looked at the beautiful things and rummaged
among them. With her tiny hands she scattered
the golden ducats, examined the goblets chased in
silver, and put upon her head the crown of gold
three times refined. She played about, looked round
and admired, and at last caught sight of a very
slender little ivory staff propped up against a mighty
pillar.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was just that slender staff that kept the
mighty pillar from collapsing, because the pillar
was already completely hollowed out by the water.
And therefore God had caused that little staff to fall
down there, and the staff held up the pillar under
the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Curlylocks wondered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why is that little staff just there?” And she
went and picked up the staff to look at it.</p>

<p class='c009'>But no sooner had Curlylocks taken the staff
and moved it than the subterranean passages re-echoed
with a terrible rumbling noise. The great pillar
trembled, swayed and crashed down amid a whole
mountain of falling earth, closing and blocking up
the path between Reygoch and Curlylocks. They
could neither see nor hear one another, nor could
they reach one another....</p>

<p class='c009'>There was the poor little fairy Curlylocks caught
in the bowels of the earth! She was buried alive
in that vast grave, and perhaps would never again
see those golden fields for which she had set out,
and all because she would not go straight on by
the way they had intended, but would loiter and
turn aside to the right and to the left to pry into
God’s secrets!</p>

<p class='c009'>Curlylocks wept and cried, and tried to get
to Reygoch. But she found that there was no way
through, and that her plight was hopeless; and as
for the bag of pearls, which might have helped her,
it was buried under the landslide.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Curlylocks realised this she stopped
crying, for she was proud, and she thought: “There
is no help for it, and I must die. Reygoch won’t
come to my rescue, because his wits are too
slow even to help himself, let alone to make him
remember to help me. So there is nothing for it,
and I must die.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Curlylocks prepared for death. But in case
folk should ever find her in her grave she wanted
them to know that she came of royal blood. So
she set the crown of gold three times refined upon
her head, took the ivory staff in her hand, and lay
down to die. There was no one beside Curlylocks
except her little lantern, burning as if it were lit
with gold; and as Curlylocks began to grow cold
and stiff, so the lantern burned low and dim.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reygoch was really an old stupid. When the
pillar crashed down and there was the big landslide
between him and Curlylocks he never moved, but
sat still in the dark. Thus he sat for quite a long
time, before it occurred to him to go and find out
what had happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>He felt his way in the dark to the spot where
Curlylocks had been, groped about, and realised that
the earth had subsided there and that the passage
was indeed blocked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh, but that way is choked up now,” considered
Reygoch. And nothing else could he think
of, but turned round, left the mound of fallen earth
and Curlylocks beyond it, and went back by the
road they had travelled from Frosten city.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c009'>Thus old Reygoch went his way, pillar by pillar.
He had already gone a goodish bit; but there was
all the time something worrying him. Reygoch
himself couldn’t imagine what it was that worried
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He arranged the strap around his waist—perhaps
it had been too tight; and then he stretched
his arm—perhaps his arm had gone to sleep. Yet
it was neither the one nor the other, but something
else that worried. Reygoch wondered what in the
world it could be. He wondered, and as he wondered
he shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>And as Reygoch shook his head, the little
basket swung at his ear. And when Reygoch felt
how light the basket was, and that there was no
Curlylocks inside, a bitter pang shot through his
heart and breast, and—simpleton though he was—he
knew well enough that he was grieved because
he missed Curlylocks, and he realised also that he
ought to save her.</p>

<p class='c009'>It had taken Reygoch a lot of trouble to think
out all that; but once he had thought it out, he
turned like the wind and flew back to the place
where the landslide was, to find Curlylocks behind
the heap of earth. He flew, and arrived just in time.
Reygoch burrowed away with both hands, and in
a little while he had burrowed a big hole, so that he
could see Curlylocks lying there, the crown of fine
gold on her head. She was already growing cold
and rigid, with her little lantern beside her, and
the flame of it as feeble as the tiniest little glow-worm.</p>

<p class='c009'>If Reygoch had cried out in his grief the earth
would have rocked, and the little lantern would
have gone out altogether—even the little glow-worm
light by the side of Curlylocks would have died
away.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Reygoch’s throat was all tight with pain,
so that he could not cry out. He put out his great
big hand and gently picked up poor Curlylocks, who
was already quite cold, and warmed her between
the hollowed palms of his huge hands as you would
warm a starved dicky-bird in winter. And lo! in
a little while Curlylocks moved her little head, and
at once the lantern burned a little brighter; and
then Curlylocks moved her arm, and the lantern
burned brighter still. At last Curlylocks opened
her eyes, and the lantern burned as brightly as if
its flame were pure gold!</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Curlylocks jumped to her feet, caught
hold of Reygoch’s beard, and they both of them
cried for pure joy. Reygoch’s tears were as big as
pears and Curlylocks’ as tiny as millet-seed, but
except for size they were both the same sort; and
from that moment these two were mightily fond
of one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they had finished their cry, Curlylocks
found her pearls, and then they went on. But they
touched no more of the things they saw underground,
neither the sunken ships with their hoards of treasure,
which had worked their way down from the bottom
of the sea, nor the red coral, nor the yellow
amber which twined round the underground pillars.
They touched nothing, but went straight along
by the way that would take them to the golden
fields.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they had gone on thus for a long time,
Curlylocks asked Reygoch to hold her up; and
when he did so, Curlylocks took a handful of earth
from above her head.</p>

<p class='c009'>She took the earth, looked at her hand, and
there, among the soil, she found leaves and
fibres.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here we are, daddy, under the forest beside
the golden fields,” said Curlylocks. “Let’s hurry up
and get out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Reygoch stretched himself and began to break
through the earth with his head.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>II</h3>

<p class='c011'>And indeed they were under the forest, just
underneath a wooded glen between the two villages
and the two counties. No one ever came to this
glen but the herd boys and girls from both villages
and both counties.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now there was bitter strife between the two
villages—strife over the threshing-floors, and the
pastures, and the mills, and the timber-felling, and
most of all over the staff of headmanship, which one
of the villages had long claimed as belonging to it
by rights, and the other would not give up. And
so these two villages were at enmity with one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the herd boys and girls of both villages
were just simple young folk, who understood nothing
about the rights of their elders, and cared less, but
met every day on the boundary between the two
villages and the two counties. Their flocks mingled
and fed together, while the boys played games, and
over their games would often be late in bringing the
sheep home of an evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>For this the poor boys and girls would be
soundly rated and scolded in both villages. But in
one of the villages there was a great-grandfather
and a great-grandmother who could remember all
that had ever happened in either village, and they
said: “Leave the children alone. A better harvest
will spring from their childish games than ever from
your wheat in the fields.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So the shepherds kept on coming, as before,
with their sheep to the glen, and in time the parents
stopped bothering about what the children did.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so it was on the day when Reygoch broke
through the earth at that very spot. The boys and
girls happened to be all gathered together under the
biggest oak, getting ready to go home. One was
tying up his shoes, another fixing a thong to a stick,
and the girls were collecting the sheep. All of a
sudden they heard a dreadful thumping in the earth
right underneath their feet! There was a thud,
then a second, and at the third thud the earth
gaped, and up there came, right in the midst of
the shepherds, a fearsome large head as big as a
barrel, with a beard like a shock of corn, and the
beard still bristling with hoar-frost from Frosten
city!</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys and girls all screamed with fright and
fell down in a dead faint—not so much because of
the head as big as a barrel, but because of the beard,
that looked for all the world like a shock of corn!</p>

<p class='c009'>So the shepherds fainted away—all but young
Lilio, who was the handsomest and cleverest among
the lads of both villages and both counties.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lilio kept his feet, and went close up to see
what sort of monster it might be.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be afraid, children,” said Lilio to the
shepherds. “The Lord never created that monstrous
giant for evil, else he would have killed half the
world by now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Lilio walked boldly up to Reygoch, and
Reygoch lifted the basket with Curlylocks down from
his ear and set it on the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come—oh come quickly, boys!” cried Lilio.
“There is a little girl with him, little and lovely as
a star!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The herd boys and girls got up and began to
peep from behind each other at Curlylocks; and
those who had at first been the most frightened
were now the foremost in coming up to Curlylocks,
because, you see, they were always quickest in
everything.</p>

<p class='c009'>No sooner had the herd boys and girls seen dear
little Curlylocks than they loved her. They helped
her out of her basket, led her to where the turf was
softest, and fell to admiring her lovely robes, which
were light as gossamer and blue as the sky, and her
hair, which was shining and soft as the morning
light; but most of all they admired her fairy veil,
for she would wave it just for a moment, and then
rise from the grass and float in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>The herd boys and girls and Curlylocks danced
in a ring together, and played all kinds of games.
Curlylocks’ little feet twinkled for pure joy, her
eyes laughed, and so did her lips, because she had
found companions who liked the same things as
she did.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Curlylocks brought out her little bag of
pearls to give presents and pleasure to her new
friends. She threw down a pearl, and a little tree
grew up in their midst, all decked with coloured
ribbons, silk kerchiefs and red necklaces for the
girls. She threw down a second pearl, and from
all parts of the forest came forth haughty peacocks;
they stalked and strutted, they flew up and away,
shedding their glorious feathers all over the turf,
so that the grass fairly sparkled with them. And the
herd boys stuck the feathers in their caps and
doublets. Yet another pearl did Curlylocks throw
out, and from a lofty branch there dropped a golden
swing with silken ropes; and when the boys and
girls got on the swing, it swooped and stooped as
light as a swallow, and as gently as the grand barge
of the Duke of Venice.</p>

<p class='c009'>The children shouted for joy, and Curlylocks
threw out all the pearls in her bag one after another,
never thinking that she ought to save them; because
Curlylocks liked nothing in the world better than
lovely games and pretty songs. And so she spent
her pearls down to the last little seed pearl, though
heaven alone knew how badly she would need them
soon, both she and her new friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall never leave you any more,” cried
Curlylocks merrily. And the herd boys and girls
clapped their hands and threw up their caps for
joy over her words.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only Lilio had not joined in their games, because
he was rather sad and worried that day. He stayed
near Reygoch, and from there he watched Curlylocks
in all her loveliness, and all the pretty magic
she made there in the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meantime Reygoch had come out of his hole.
Out he came and stood up among the trees of the
forest, and as he stood there his head rose above
the hundred-year-old forest, so terribly big was
Reygoch.</p>

<p class='c009'>Over the forest looked Reygoch, and out into
the plain.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun had already set, and the sky was all
crimson. In the plain you could see the two golden
fields spread out like two gold kerchiefs, and in the
midst of the fields two villages like two white doves.
A little way beyond the two villages flowed the
mighty River Banewater, and all along the river rose
great grass-grown dykes; and on the dykes you
could see herds and their keepers moving.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well!” said Reygoch, “and to think that
I have spent a thousand years in Frosten city, in
that desert, when there is so much beauty in the
world!” And Reygoch was so delighted with looking
into the plain that he just stood there with his great
head as big as a barrel turning from right to left,
like a huge scarecrow nodding above the tree-tops.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Lilio called to him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sit down, daddy, for fear the elders of the
villages should see you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reygoch sat down, and the two started talking,
and Lilio told Reygoch why he was so sad that
day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A very wicked thing is going to happen to-day,”
said Lilio. “I overheard the elders of our
village talking last night, and this is what they said:
‘Let us pierce the dyke along the River Banewater.
The river will widen the hole, the dyke will fall,
and the water will flood the enemy village; it will
drown men and women, flood the graveyard and
the fields, till the water will be level above them,
and nothing but a lake to show where the enemy
village has been. But our fields are higher, and our
village lies on a height, and so no harm will come
to us.’ And then they really went out with a
great ram to pierce the dyke secretly and at dead of
night. But, daddy,” continued Lilio, “I know that
our fields are not so high, and I know that the water
will overflow them too, and before the night is over
there will be a lake where our two villages used to
be. And that is why I am so sad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They were still talking when a terrible noise
and clamour arose from the plain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There!” cried Lilio, “the dreadful thing has
happened!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reygoch drew himself up, picked up Lilio, and
the two looked out over the plain. It was a sad
sight to see! The dyke was crumbling, and the
mighty Black Banewater rolling in two arms across
the beautiful fields. One arm rolled towards the
one village, and the second arm towards the other
village. Animals were drowning, the golden fields
disappeared below the flood. Above the graves the
crosses were afloat, and both villages rang with
cries and shouting. For in both villages the elders
had gone out to the threshing-floors with cymbals,
drums and fifes, and there they were drumming and
piping away each to spite the other village, so crazed
were they with malice, while over and above that
din the village dogs howled dismally, and the
women and children wept and wailed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Daddy,” cried Lilio, “why have I not your
hands to stop the water?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Terrified and bewildered by the dreadful clamour
in the plain, the herd boys and girls crowded round
Reygoch and Lilio.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Curlylocks heard what was the matter
she called out quick and sprightly, as befits a little
fairy:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, Reygoch—come on and stop the
water!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes, let’s go!” cried the herd boys of
both villages and both counties, as they wept and
sobbed without stopping. “Come on, Reygoch, and
take us along too!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reygoch stooped, gathered up Lilio and Curlylocks
(who was still carrying her lantern) in his
right hand, and all the rest of the herd boys and
girls in his left, and then Reygoch raced with ten-fathom
strides through the forest clearing and down
into the plain. Behind him ran the sheep, bleating
with terror. And so they reached the plain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Through fog and twilight ran Reygoch with the
children in his arms and the terrified flocks at his
heels in frantic flight—all running towards the dyke.
And out to meet them flowed the Black Banewater,
killing and drowning as it flowed. It is terribly
strong, is that water. Stronger than Reygoch? Who
knows? Will it sweep away Reygoch, too? Will it
drown those poor herd boys and girls also, and
must the dear little Fairy Curlylocks die—and she
as lovely as a star?</p>

<p class='c009'>So Reygoch ran on across the meadow, which
was still dry, and came all breathless to the dyke,
where there was a great breach, through which the
river was pouring with frightful force.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop it up, Reygoch—stop it up!” wailed the
boys and girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not far from the dyke there was a little mound
in the plain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Put us on that mound,” cried Curlylocks
briskly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reygoch set down Lilio and Curlylocks and the
herd boys and girls on the hillock, and the sheep
and lambs crowded round them. Already the hillock
was just an island in the middle of the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Reygoch took one mighty stride into the
water and then lay down facing the dyke, stopping
up the breach with his enormous chest. For a little
while the water ceased to flow; but it was so terribly
strong that nothing on earth could stop it. The
water pressed forward; it eddied round Reygoch’s
shoulders; it broke through under him, over him,
about him—everywhere—and rolled on again over
the plain. Reygoch stretched out both arms and
piled up the earth in great handfuls; but as fast as
he piled it up, the water carried it away.</p>

<p class='c009'>And in the plain the water kept on rising higher
and higher; fields, villages, cattle, threshing-floors,
not one of them could be seen any more. Of both
villages, the roofs and church steeples were all that
showed above the flood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even around the hillock where the herd boys
and girls were standing with Lilio and Curlylocks
the flood was rising higher and higher. The poor
young things were weeping and crying, some for
their mothers, others for their brothers and sisters,
and some for their homes and gardens; because
they saw that both villages had perished, and not
a soul saved—and the water rising about them, too!</p>

<p class='c009'>So they crowded up higher and higher upon
the hillock; they huddled together around Lilio
and Curlylocks, who were standing side by side in
the midst of their friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lilio stood still and white as marble; but
Curlylocks’ eyes shone, and she held up her lantern
towards Reygoch to give him light for his work.
Curlylocks’ veil rose and fluttered in the night wind
and hovered above the water, as though the little
fairy were about to fly away and vanish from among
all these terrors.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Curlylocks! Curlylocks! don’t go! Don’t
leave us!” wailed the herd boys, to whom it seemed
as if there were an angel with them while they could
look upon Curlylocks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not going—I’m not going away!” cried
Curlylocks. But her veil fluttered, as if it would
carry her away of its own accord, over the water
and up into the clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly they heard a scream. The water had
risen and caught one of the girls by the hem of her
skirt and was washing her away. Lilio stooped just
in time, seized the girl, and pulled her back on to
the hillock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must tie ourselves together,” cried the
herd boys; “we must be tied each to the other,
or we shall perish.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, children—here!” cried Curlylocks, who
had a kind and pitiful heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>Quickly she stripped her magic veil off her
shoulders and gave it to the herd girls. They tore
the veil into strips, knotted the strips into long ropes,
and bound themselves together, each to other, round
Lilio and Curlylocks. And round the shepherds
bleated the poor sheep in terror of being drowned.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Curlylocks was now among these poor castaways,
no better off than the rest of them. Her
pearls she had wasted on toys, and her magic veil
she had given away and torn up out of the goodness
of her heart, and now she could no longer fly, nor
save herself out of this misery.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Lilio loved Curlylocks better than anything
else in the world, and when the water was already
up to his feet he called:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be afraid, Curlylocks! I will save you
and hold you up!” And he held up Curlylocks
in his arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>With one hand Curlylocks clung round Lilio’s
neck, and with the other she held up her little
lantern aloft towards Reygoch.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Reygoch, lying on his chest in the water,
was all the time steadily fighting the flood. Right
and left of Reygoch rose the ruins of the dyke like
two great horns. Reygoch’s beard was touzled, his
shoulders were bleeding. Yet he could not stop the
Banewater, and the flood round the hillock was
rising and rising to drown the poor remnant there.
And now it was night—yea, midnight.</p>

<p class='c009'>All of a sudden a thought flashed through
Curlylocks, and through all the sobbing and crying
she laughed aloud as she called to Reygoch:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Reygoch, you old simpleton! why don’t you
<i>sit</i> between these two horns of the dyke? Why
don’t you dam the flood with your shoulders?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The herd boys and girls stopped wailing at
once. So dumbfounded were they at the idea that
not one of them had thought of that before!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uhuhu!” was all you could hear, and that
was Reygoch laughing. And when Reygoch laughs,
mind you, it’s no joke! All the water round him
boiled and bubbled as he shook with laughter over
his own stupidity!</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Reygoch stood up, faced about, and—in
a twinkling—he sat down between those two horns!</p>

<p class='c009'>And then happened the most wonderful thing
of all! For the Black Banewater stood as though
you had rolled a wall into the breach! It stood, and
could not rise above Reygoch’s shoulders, but followed
its usual course, as before, the whole current behind
Reygoch’s back. And surely that was a most
marvellous rescue!</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys and girls were saved from the worst
of the danger; and Reygoch, sitting comfortably,
took up earth in handfuls and all slow-and-surely
rebuilt the dyke under himself and on either hand.
He began in the middle of the night, and when
the dawn broke, the job was finished. And just
as the sun rose, Reygoch got up from the dyke with
his work done, and started combing his beard, which
was all caked with mud, twigs, and little fishes.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the poor boys and girls were not yet done
with their troubles; for where were they to go, and
how were they to get there? There they stood on
the top of the hillock. All around them was a waste
of water. Nothing was to be seen of the two villages
but just a few roofs—and not a soul alive in either.
To be sure, the villagers might have saved themselves
if they had taken refuge in their attics. But
in both villages everybody had gone to the threshing-floor
with cymbals and fifes to make merry, so
that each could watch the destruction of the other.
And when the water was up to their waists, they
were still clanging their cymbals; and when it was
up to their necks, they still blew their fifes for
gratified spite. And so they were drowned, one and
all, with their fifes and cymbals—and serve them
right for their malice and uncharitableness!</p>

<p class='c009'>So the poor children were left without a soul
to cherish or protect them, all houseless and homeless.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re not sparrows, to live on the housetops,”
said the boys sadly, as they saw only the
roofs sticking out of the water, “and we’re not
foxes, to live in burrows in the hills. If someone
could clear our villages of the water, we might
make shift to get along somehow, but as it is, we
might as well jump into the water with our flocks
and be drowned like the rest, for we have nowhere
and no one to turn to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That was a sad plight indeed, and Reygoch
himself was dreadfully sorry for them. But here
was an evil he could in no wise remedy. He looked
out over the water and said: “There’s too much
water here for me to bale out or to drink up so as
to clear your villages. Eh, children, what shall I
do for you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But then up and spoke Lilio, that was the wisest
lad in these parts:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Reygoch, daddy, if <i>you</i> cannot drink so much
water, <i>the Earth can</i>. Break a hole in the ground,
daddy, and drain off the water into the earth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dearie me! and wasn’t that great wisdom in
a lad no bigger than Reygoch’s finger?</p>

<p class='c009'>Forthwith Reygoch stamped on the ground
and broke a hole; and the Earth, like a thirsty
dragon, began to drink and to drink, and swallow,
and suck down into herself all that mighty water
from off the whole plain. Before long the Earth
had gulped down all the water; villages, fields,
and meadows reappeared, ravaged and mud-covered,
to be sure, but with everything in its right place.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young castaways cheered up at the sight,
but none was so glad as Curlylocks. She clapped
her hands and cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, won’t it be lovely when the fields all
grow golden again and the meadows green!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But hereupon the herd boys and girls were all
downcast once more, and Lilio said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who will show us how to till the ground
now that not one of our parents is left alive?”</p>

<p class='c009'>And indeed, far and wide, there was not a soul
alive older than that company of helpless young
things in the midst of the ravaged plain, and none
with them but Reygoch, who was so big and clumsy
and simple that he could not turn his head inside
one of their houses, nor did he know anything
about ploughing or husbandry.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they were all in the dumps once more, and
most of all Reygoch, who was so fond of pretty
Curlylocks, and now he could do nothing for her
nor her friends!</p>

<p class='c009'>And, worst of all, Reygoch was getting horribly
homesick for his desolate city of Frosten. This
night he had swallowed mud enough to last him
a thousand years, and seen more than enough of
trouble. And so he was just dying to be back in his
vast, empty city, where he had counted the stones
in peace for so many hundred years.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the herd boys were very crestfallen, and
Lilio was crestfallen, and Reygoch the most crestfallen
of all. And really it was sad to look upon
all these poor boys and girls, doomed to perish
without their parents and wither like a flower cut
off from its root.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only Curlylocks looked gaily about her, right and
left, for nothing could damp her good spirits.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly Curlylocks cried out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look—oh look! What are those people? Oh
dear, but they must have seen sights and wonders!”</p>

<p class='c009'>All looked towards the village, and there, at
one of the windows, appeared the heads of an aged
couple—an old man and an old woman. They
waved their kerchiefs, they called the young people
by name, and laughed till their wrinkled faces all
shone with joy. They were great-grandfather and
great-grandmother, who had been the only sensible
people in the two villages, and had saved themselves
by taking refuge in the attic!</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh dear! If the children had seen the sun at
his rising and the morning star at that attic window,
they would not have shouted so for joy. The very
heavens rang again as they called out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Granny! Grandad!”</p>

<p class='c009'>They raced to the village like young whippets,
Curlylocks in front, with her golden hair streaming
in the wind, and after them the ewes and lambs.
They never stopped till they reached the village,
and there grandfather and grandmother were waiting
for them at the gate. They welcomed them, hugged
them, and none of them could find words to thank
God enough for His mercy in giving grandad and
grandma so much wisdom as to make them take
refuge in the attic! And that was really a very
good thing, because these were only quite simple
villages, where there were no books nor written
records; and who would have reminded the herd
boys and girls of the consequences of wickedness
if grandad and grandma had not been spared?</p>

<p class='c009'>When they had done hugging each other, they
remembered Reygoch. They looked round the plain,
but there was no Reygoch. He was gone—gone all
of a sudden, the dear huge thing—gone like a mouse
down its hole.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Reygoch had indeed gone like a mouse
down its hole. For when grandpa and grandma
appeared at the attic window, Reygoch got a fright
such as he had never yet had in his life. He was
terrified at the sight of their furrowed, wrinkled,
withered old faces.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh dear! oh dear! what a lot of trouble these
old people must have been through in these parts
to have come to look like that!” thought Reygoch;
and in his terror he that very instant jumped down
into the hole through which the Black Banewater
had sunk down, and so ran away back to his
desolate Frosten city.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c009'>All went well in the village. Grandad and
Grandma taught the young folk, and the young
folk ploughed and sowed. Upon the grandparents’
advice they built just one village, one threshing-floor,
one church, and one graveyard, so that there
should be no more jealousy nor trouble.</p>

<p class='c009'>All went well; but the best of all was that in
the heart of the village stood a beautiful tower of
mountain marble, and on the top of it they had
made a garden, where blossomed oranges and
wild olive. There lived Curlylocks, the lovely
fairy, and looked down upon the land that had been
so dear to her from the moment when she first
came to earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>And of an evening, when the field work was
done, Lilio would lead the herd boys and girls to
the tower, and they would sing songs and dance in
a ring in the garden with Curlylocks, always lovely,
gentle, and joyous.</p>

<p class='c009'>But under the earth Reygoch once more fell
in with the Black Banewater as it roared and
burbled underneath, while he wrestled with it till
he forced it deeper and deeper into the earth, and
right down to the bottom of the Pit, so that it might
never again serve the spite and envy of man. And
then Reygoch went on to Frosten city. There he
is sitting to this very day, counting the stones and
praying the Lord never again to tempt him away
from that vast and desolate spot, which is the very
place for one so big and so simple.</p>

  <h2 id='ch04' class='c004'>Bridesman Sun<br />and<br />Bride Bridekins</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>ONCE upon a time there was a miller
and his wife, and both were miserly and
hard of heart. When the Emperor’s
servants brought corn to be ground, the
miller would grind the corn free of all charge and
send the Emperor a gift into the bargain, only to gain
favour with the mighty Emperor and his daughter,
the proud princess. But when poor folk came to
have their corn ground, the miller would take one
measure in payment for every two that he ground,
and without that he would not grind at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day, just about Yuletide and in the time
of bitter frost, an old wife came to the mill—an
old wife all patches and tatters. The mill stood in
a little grove by the stream, and no one could
say whence that old wife had come.</p>

<p class='c009'>But this wasn’t just an old wife like other old
wives; it was Mother Muggish. Now Muggish
could turn herself into any mortal thing, a bird or
a snake, or an old woman or a young girl. And
besides that she could do anything, both good and
bad. But woe to him who got into her bad books,
for she was very spiteful. Muggish lived in the
morass on the fringe of the bog where the autumn
sun dwelt. And with her the sun put up over the
long winter night; for Muggish knew potent herbs
and powerful spells; she would nurse and cherish
the feeble old sun till he grew young again at Yuletide
and started on his way once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good day to you,” Mother Muggish called
out to the miller and his wife. “Just grind this
bag of corn for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old wife stood the bag on the floor, and the
miller agreed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll grind it for you; half the bag for
you for your cake, and half for me for my
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not so, my son! I shall not have enough
for my Yuletide cake, because I have six sons, and
for seventh my grandson, the Sun, who was born
to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go away and don’t talk rubbish, you old fool!”
burst out the miller. “A likely one you are to be
the Sun’s grandmother!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they argued this way and that; but the
miller wouldn’t consent to grind for less than one-half
the bag, and so the old wife picked up her bag
again and went away by the way she came.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the miller had a daughter, a beautiful girl,
called Bride Bridekins. When she was born, the
fairies bathed her in the water that falls from the
wheel, so that all evils should turn from her, even
as water runs away from a mill. And, moreover, the
fairies foretold that at her wedding the Sun should
be bridesman. Just fancy! she was the Sun’s little
bride! So they called her Bride Bridekins, and she
was most beautiful and smiling as a summer’s day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bride Bridekins was sorry when the miller sent
away the old wife so unkindly. She went out and
waited in the wood for the old wife, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come again to-morrow, Mother, when I shall be
alone. I will grind your corn for you for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Next day the miller and his wife went into the
wood to cut the Yule log, and Bride Bridekins was
left alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before long the old wife came up with her bag.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good fortune be yours, young maiden,” said
the wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And yours, too,” returned Bride Bridekins.
“Wait a moment, Mother, till we open the mill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The mill was worked by a little wheel which
caught the water with four paddles set cross-wise,
which turned like a spindle. Now the miller had
shut off the water, and Bride Bridekins had to wade
up to her knees in the icy stream to open the sluice.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mill clattered, round went the mill-stones,
and Bride Bridekins ground the old wife’s corn.
She filled up the bag with flour and took nothing
for her pains.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh, thank you kindly, maiden,” said Mother
Muggish, “and I’ll help you whithersoever your
feet may carry you, since your feet you did not
save from the ice-cold wave, nor grudge your hands
to soil with unrequited toil. And, moreover, I’ll
tell my grandson, the Sun, to whom he owes his
Yuletide cake.” And the old wife took up her bag
and went.</p>

<p class='c009'>From that day nothing would prosper in the
mill without Bride Bridekins. Unless her hand was
on the mill, the paddles would not take the water;
unless she looked in the bin, there would be no flour
in it. No matter how much might fall into it from
the grain-box, it was all lost on the floor; the bin
remained empty unless Bride Bridekins fed the mill.
And so it was with everything in and about the
mill.</p>

<p class='c009'>This went on for many a day, on and on and
never any change, till the miller and his wife began
to be jealous of their daughter and to hate her.
The harder the girl worked and the more she earned,
the blacker they looked at her, because it came to
her as easy as a song, and to them not even with
toiling and moiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was upon a morning about Beltane time,
when the Sun, strong and flaming, travels across
one-half of heaven like a ball of pure gold. The
Sun no longer slept in the morass, nor did Muggish
foster him now; but the Sun was lord of the world,
and sky and earth obeyed him. Bride Bridekins
sat at Beltane time beside the mill and thought to
herself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I could only get away, since I cannot please
these cross-patches anyhow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And just as she thought this, there appeared
before her the old wife, who was really Muggish.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will help you, but you must obey me in
all things, and take care not to offend me,” said the
old wife. “This very morning the proud princess
walked in the meadow and lost the keys of her chest
and her wardrobe, and now she cannot get at her
crown nor her robes either. So the princess has
caused it to be proclaimed that whoever finds the
keys, if it be a youth the princess will become his
true love and bride-to-be, and if it be a maiden,
the princess will take her for her first lady-in-waiting.
So you come away with me, and I will show you
where the keys are lying among the love-lies-bleeding
that grows in the meadow. You will bring the
princess her keys and become her first lady-in-waiting.
You will be dressed in silk and sit by the
princess’s knee.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/i144a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then Muggish at once turned herself into a
quail, and Bride Bridekins followed her.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they came to the meadow in front of the
Emperor’s castle. Gallant knights and noble dames
walked about the meadow, and around the meadow
stood their esquires holding mettlesome steeds.
One steed only was not held by a squire, but by a
barefoot boy. This horse belonged to Oleg the
Warden, and it was the most fiery steed of all. And
Oleg the Warden himself was the most excellent
knight under the sun. You might know Oleg the
Warden amid ever so many earls and nobles, because
his attire was plain and without ornament, but his
white plume, the prize of valour, distinguished him
above all the rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the knights and dames walked about the
meadow, all trampling the grass with their shoes
in their anxiety to find the keys. Only Oleg the
Warden kept but a poor look-out for the keys,
taking the matter as a mere jest and idle pastime. But
from her window the Emperor’s daughter looked
out and watched to see whom fortune would favour.
Very careful watch did she keep, the proud princess,
and repeated spells for luck so that Oleg the Warden
should find the keys.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Bride Bridekins came with the quail
running before her, not a soul in the meadow noticed
her but only Oleg the Warden.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never yet have I seen so sweet a maiden,”
thought Oleg the Warden, and strode towards her.</p>

<p class='c009'>But just then the Emperor’s daughter also
noticed Bride Bridekins from her window, and so
proud and heartless was she that she never stopped
to look how sweet the maiden was, but grew very
angry, and said: “A fine plight should I be in were
that common wench there to find the keys and
become my lady-in-waiting!” Thus thinking, she
at once sent out her servants to drive away the girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bride Bridekins went over the meadow where-ever
the quail led her. They came to the middle
of the meadow, where the love-lies-bleeding grew
tall. The quail parted two leaves at the foot of a
tuft of love-lies-bleeding, and under them lay the
keys.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bride Bridekins bent down and picked up the
keys; but when she looked up to the Emperor’s
castle and saw the proud princess, Bride Bridekins
became frightened, and thought: “How should I
become the princess’s lady-in-waiting?”</p>

<p class='c009'>As she thought this she looked up, and lo, beside
her stood a glorious knight, as he might have been
sworn brother to the Sun. And that was Oleg the
Warden.</p>

<p class='c009'>Quickly Bride Bridekins made up her mind to
disobey Muggish’s commands, and she held out the
keys to Oleg the Warden.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take the keys, unknown knight, and let the
Emperor’s daughter be your true love and bride-to-be,”
said Bride Bridekins, and could not take
her eyes off the glorious knight.</p>

<p class='c009'>But at that moment came the servants with
whips, and roughly rated Bride Bridekins so as to
drive her away from the meadow, according to the
princess’s commands. When Oleg the Warden saw
this, he was soon resolved, and thus did he answer
Bride Bridekins:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you for the keys, sweet maiden; but
I have made up my mind otherwise. <i>You</i> shall be
my true love and bride-to-be, because you are fairer
than the morning star. Here is my good horse;
he will carry us to my Barren Marches.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gladly did Bride Bridekins go with Oleg the
Warden, and he lifted her beside him on to his
horse. As the good steed carried them swiftly past
the Emperor’s daughter sitting at her window. Oleg
the Warden threw her the keys so skilfully that
they caught right on the window latch!</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are your keys, august Princess!” cried
Oleg the Warden. “Wear your crown and your
robes in all happiness, for I have taken the maiden
for myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All that night Oleg the Warden rode on with
Bride Bridekins, and at dawn they arrived in the
Barren Marches, at the oaken stronghold of Oleg
the Warden. Round the stockade there were three
moats, and in the midst of the stockade stood a
smoke-blacked house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Behold the Castle of Oleg the Warden!” said
the knight to Bride Bridekins, and he laughed himself
because his castle was not more splendid. But
Bride Bridekins laughed still more heartily because
she was to be the lady of such a glorious knight.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they settled at once upon the wedding
guests, so as to celebrate the marriage. They invited
twenty gallants and twenty orphan maids, because
that was all the people there were in the Barren
Marches. And so that they might be more and
merrier, they also asked the Wild Wolf and his Mate
from the hills, and the Tawny Eagle, and the Grey
Goshawk; and Bride Bridekins asked two bridesmaids—the
Turtle Dove and the Slender Swallow.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Bride Bridekins even boasted to Oleg the
Warden:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the Sun were to recognise me, he too would
come to the wedding. The Sun would have been
bridesman at the wedding, for so did the fairies
foretell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And so the wedding guests assembled in the
soot-blacked castle, to make merry—and never
knew of the ill fate in store for them.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c009'>Now it had stung the proud princess to the
heart when Oleg the Warden had flung her the keys,
and before so many nobles, before earls and knights,
refused the august princess and preferred a nameless
maiden.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the princess persuaded the Emperor, her
father, and begged and entreated him till he lent
her his mighty army. Well mounted, the army
advanced upon the Barren Marches of Oleg the
Warden with the wrathful princess at its head.</p>

<p class='c009'>The guests were just at table when the army
came in sight. It was so great that it covered all
the Barren Marches till you could not see so much
as a patch of earth for it. And in front of the army
a herald cried aloud for all the world to hear:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Behold a gallant army</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Has taken the field;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Warden is a rebel,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>We bid him to yield.</div>
      <div class='line'>Alive shall he be taken</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That freedom loved best;</div>
      <div class='line'>But the heart shall be riven</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From his lady’s breast.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>When Oleg the Warden heard this, he asked
Bride Bridekins:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you afraid, lovely maiden?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not afraid,” she smilingly made answer.
“I put my trust in the Grey Wolf and his Mate,
in your twenty gallants and twenty orphans, and
most of all in the knight Oleg the Warden. And
besides that I have two brave bridesmaids—the
Turtle Dove and the Slender Swallow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Oleg the Warden smiled, and already the wedding
guests had lightly sprung to their feet. They seized
their warriors’ weapons, both gallants and orphans,
and stood by the windows of the soot-blacked
castle stringing their good bows with silken cords
as they waited for the princess and her army. But
that army was so mighty that neither Oleg the
Warden, nor his wedding guests, nor the soot-blacked
house were able to withstand it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first to fall were the Grey Wolf and his
Mate; for they jumped the stockade and the moats
and rushed straight at the Emperor’s army to tear
out the proud princess’s eyes in the midst of her
army. But a hundred maces rose in the air; the
soldiers defended the proud princess, the Eagle and
the Grey Goshawk had their pinions broken, and
then the heavy horses trampled them into the black
earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The great host came nearer and nearer to the
soot-blacked house. When it was fairly on the
threshold the wedding guests loosed their silken
bowstrings and greeted the soldiers with a shower
of arrows.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the wrathful archers of the wrathful princess
did not stop!</p>

<p class='c009'>Arrows flew hither and thither. There were
archers past counting in the army, so that their
arrows flew in at the windows of the soot-blacked
house like a plague from heaven. Each gallant had
his two or three wounds to show, and each orphan
some ten.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the most grievous wound of all was upon
Oleg the Warden. His good right hand hung
powerless, so greatly was he overcome by his
wound.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id013'>
<img src='images/i152a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>Quickly Bride Bridekins stepped up to Oleg
the Warden to wash his wound in the courtyard of
the soot-blacked house. While she was washing his
wound, Oleg the Warden said to her:
“It’s a poor fortune we have garnered, my
Bride Bridekins. There are none left for you to put
your trust in, and here is the host at the gates of
the soot-blacked house. They will break down the
oak stockade, batter down the ancient gates. We
are lost; this is the end of us—wolves and eagles,
and gallants and orphans, and Oleg the Warden
and his Bride Bridekins!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Bride Bridekins considered sadly, and then
she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not fear, brave Warden. I will send the
Turtle Dove to fetch Muggish from her morass.
There is nothing Muggish does not know and
nothing she cannot do, and she will help us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Bride Bridekins sent out the swift Turtle
Dove. Away flew the grey dove swifter than an
arrow from the string, nor did the soldiers’ darts
overtake her. Off she flew and brought back Muggish
from the bog. But Muggish had turned herself into
a raven and perched upon the gable of the soot-blacked
House.</p>

<p class='c009'>Already the soldiers were battering at the
entrance. Heavy clubs hammered on the doors and
portals, banging and clanging till all the courts and
passages of the soot-blacked house rang again, as
though a host from the nethermost Pit were beating
on the gates of Oleg the Warden.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fair greeting, dear Muggish!” the lovely Bride
appealed to the black raven—“fair greeting! Help
us against the Princess’s malice, or else we must all
die untimely!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Muggish had only bided her time spitefully
for an opportunity to give vent to her grievance.
Flapping her black wings, the raven said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Save yourself, my little dove! If you had
listened to me, you would have given the Princess
her keys. You would have basked in royal grace,
beside the Princess had your place, in sumptuous
silk fair to behold, sipping wine from a cup of
gold. But now you have gotten your heart’s desire.
Here you are in the soot-blacked house with
none but sore-wounded beggars within and a countless
host outside. Seek help from those whose
counsel brought you to this!”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Oleg the Warden heard this, he sprang
to his feet, all wounded as he was, and wrathfully
cried out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leave this unprofitable business, Bride Bridekins!
When had a hero help from a raven? And
you,” he called to Muggish, “get off my roof, you
black bird of ill-omen, lest I waste a good swift
arrow and shoot the bird upon my gable!” With that
Oleg the Warden embraced Bride Bridekins and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“When I perish in the midst of the Emperor’s
host, go, my lovely little Bride! submit yourself
to the Princess, and you shall be lady-in-waiting
to the proud Princess, who should have been true
love and lady of Oleg the Warden.” For a moment
Oleg the Warden flinched; but then he tore himself
away from his bride, and rushed through the courtyard
and passage to raise the oaken bars, to throw
open the gates to the countless host, to perish or
cut his way through their numbers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bride Bridekins was left alone in the castle,
and above her on the roof perched the black raven.
She could hear the heavy oaken bars falling; now
the ancient gates must yield; another moment and
the cruel soldiers will burst in, take Oleg prisoner,
and rive the heart out of the breast of her, sweet
child! Bride Bridekins’ thoughts chased through
her brain: What is to be done, and how?</p>

<p class='c009'>The lovely bride looked all around to see if
there were any found to pity her in her distress.
She bent her beauteous eyes to earth, and raised
them heavenward. As she raised them heavenward
the Sun travelled across the zenith in a blaze of
pure gold. And as she looked at the Sun, the Sun
marvelled at so much loveliness, and at once looked
back at her. The Sun and Bride Bridekins looked
at one another, and as they looked, they recognised
one another, and at once the Sun remembered.
“Why, that is the little bride whose Bridesman
the Sun was to be! In a lucky hour she gave me
my Yuletide bread, and in a yet luckier moment
she sought me overhead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Just one moment before the Sun had heard
Muggish mocking Bride Bridekins and spitefully
refusing to help her. So now the Sun thundered
forth his anger. All the land fell silent with fear;
axes and clubs were dropped in terror as the Sun
thundered at Muggish:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh, foster-mother, heart of stone! were the
world’s justice to be carved by spite, what crooked
justice would pervert the right! If thou from slime
hast reared me, yet content art thou to keep the
slime thine element! With me thou hast not strode
across the sky, nor from the heavens downward
bent thine eye to learn how justice should be born
of light. Fie, foster-mother, heart of stone! What!
should the Sun at Beltane in his might forget who
sent him gifts on Yule night, when he was a feeble
babe? Or shall Bridesman Sun take it ill of the bride
that she left the Emperor’s palace and the Princess’s
court because she preferred a hero in her heart?
Down with you into the earth, black-hearted nurse!
so that you underground, and I from the skies,
may help yon worthy knight and his lovely lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sky and earth obey the Sun, and how should
the black raven—and that was Muggish—withstand
his commands? Upon the instant Muggish sank
into the earth to do the Sun’s bidding.</p>

<p class='c009'>And strong as the Sun had been before, he now
made himself yet stronger. The Sun smote from
above; he scorched the Barren Marches; he seared
heaven and earth; he would have melted the Mountain
of Brass!</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon the cruel soldiers’ heads their helmets
dissolved; their heavy armour melted; spears and
axes grew red-hot. Heat overcame the wrathful
princess; heat overcame the multitude of archers
as their brains grilled inside their helmets, and their
breasts laboured with the heat under their armour.
Who had not the shelter of a roof could not live.
All the host was struck down by the heat. They fell
one atop of the other. A man would call upon his
sworn brother, and then the voice would cease as
the speaker perished.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the Sun was thus smiting the cruel soldiers,
Muggish helped the Sun from underground. She
opened deep bogholes under their feet. Whenever
the Sun struck down a man, there a boghole would
gape beneath him. He slipped into the bog, and the
bog closed above him; where a man stood, there his
grave yawned for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the soldiers vanished one by one, and the
archers one by one, and the weapons of war, and the
clubs and the axes. It was terrible to behold such a
vast army stricken by the judgment of the Sun from
the skies. The Sun was executioner and the earth
gravedigger. Yet a little while, an hour or two,
and the great host had vanished—not a soul was left
alive in the Barren Marches. Only those who were
under the roof of the soot-blacked house, they were
left alive.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once more all was still in the Barren Marches;
and now the lovely lady. Bride Bridekins, peeped
joyously from her window to watch her bridesman
grow mild, now that he had done with slaying spite
upon the earth.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c009'>Soon the wounds healed upon the gallants, for
they had good luck to help them; and the orphans
recovered still more quickly, because hardship is a
good school. As for Oleg Ban, he could not pine
with such a true love as Bride Bridekins beside him.
Early in the morning the Slender Swallow flew out
with a greeting for the Sun. At nightfall the Swallow
returned with greetings from the Sun, bidding them
prepare the wedding feast for the morrow, for he
would come to give away the bride.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they made ready, and it all fell out as they
had planned. And such a wedding as they had, and
such songs as were sung that day in the Barren Marches
you’ll not find again in a hundred years, nor throughout
nine empires.</p>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c004'>Stribor’s Forest</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c007'>I</h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>ONE day a young man went into Stribor’s
Forest and did not know that the Forest
was enchanted and that all manner of
magic abode there. Some of its magic
was good and some was bad—to each one according
to his deserts.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now this Forest was to remain enchanted until
it should be entered by someone who preferred
his sorrows to all the joys of this world.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man set to and cut wood, and presently
sat down on a stump to rest, for it was a fine winter’s
day. And out of the stump slipped a snake, and
began to fawn upon him. Now this wasn’t a real
snake, but a human being transformed into a snake
for its sins, and it could only be set free by one who
was willing to wed it. The snake sparkled like silver
in the sun as it looked up into the young man’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me, what a pretty snake! I should
rather like to take it home,” said the young man
in fun.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s the silly fool who is going to help me
out of my trouble,” thought the sinful soul within
the snake. So she made haste and turned herself
at once out of a snake into a most beautiful woman
standing there before the young man. Her sleeves
were white and embroidered like butterflies’ wings,
and her feet were tiny like a countess’s. But because
her thoughts had been evil, the tongue in her mouth
remained a serpent’s tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here I am! Take me home and marry me!”
said the snake-woman to the youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now if this youth had only had presence of
mind and remembered quickly to brandish his hatchet
at her and call out: “I certainly never thought of
wedding a piece of forest magic,” why, then the
woman would at once have turned again into a snake,
wriggled back into the stump, and no harm done to
anybody.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he was one of your good-natured, timid
and shy youths; moreover, he was ashamed to say
“No” to her, when she had transformed herself
all on his account. Besides, he liked her because
she was pretty, and he couldn’t know in his innocence
what had remained inside her mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>So he took the Woman by the hand and led her
home. Now that youth lived with his old Mother,
and he cherished his Mother as though she were
the image of a saint.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is your daughter-in-law,” said the youth,
as he entered the house with the Woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Lord be thanked, my son,” replied his
Mother, and looked at the pretty girl. But the
Mother was old and wise, and knew at once what
was inside her daughter-in-law’s mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The daughter-in-law went out to change her
dress, and the Mother said to her son:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have chosen a very pretty bride, my boy;
only beware, lest she be a snake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The youth was dumbfounded with astonishment.
How could his Mother know that the other had
been a snake? And his heart grew angry within
him as he thought: “Surely my Mother is a witch.”
And from that moment he hated his Mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the three began to live together, but badly
and discordantly. The daughter-in-law was ill-tempered,
spiteful, greedy and proud.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now there was a mountain peak there as high
as the clouds, and one day the daughter-in-law bade
the old Mother go up and fetch her snow from the
summit for her to wash in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is no path up there,” said the Mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take the goat and let her guide you. Where
she can go up, there you can tumble down,” said
the daughter-in-law.</p>

<p class='c009'>The son was there at the time, but he only
laughed at the words, simply to please his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>This so grieved the Mother that she set out
at once for the peak to fetch the snow, because she
was tired of life. As she went her way she thought
to ask God to help her; but she changed her mind
and said: “For then God would know that my son
is undutiful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But God gave her help all the same, so that she
safely brought the snow back to her daughter-in-law
from the cloud-capped peak.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next day the daughter-in-law gave her a fresh order:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go out on to the frozen lake. In the middle
of the lake there is a hole. Catch me a carp there
for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ice will give way under me, and I shall
perish in the lake,” replied the old Mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The carp will be pleased if you go down with
him,” said the daughter-in-law.</p>

<p class='c009'>And again the son laughed, and the Mother
was so grieved that she went out at once to the lake.
The ice cracked under the old woman, and she wept
so that the tears froze on her face. But yet she
would not pray to God for help; she would keep
it from God that her son was sinful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is better that I should perish,” thought the
Mother as she walked over the ice.</p>

<p class='c009'>But her time had not yet come. And therefore
a gull flew over her head, bearing a fish in its beak.
The fish wriggled out of the gull’s beak and fell right
at the feet of the old woman. The Mother picked
up the fish and brought it safely to her daughter-in-law.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the third day the Mother sat by the fire,
and took up her son’s shirt to mend it. When her
daughter-in-law saw that, she flew at her, snatched
the shirt out of her hands, and screamed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop that, you blind old fool! That is none of
your business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And she would not let the Mother mend her
son’s shirt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the old woman’s heart was altogether
saddened, so that she went outside, sat in that bitter
cold on the bench before the house, and cried to
God:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh God, help me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>At that moment she saw a poor girl coming
towards her. The girl’s bodice was all torn and her
shoulder blue with the cold, because the sleeve had
given way. But still the girl smiled, for she was
bright and sweet-tempered. Under her arm she
carried a bundle of kindling-wood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you buy wood for kindling, Mother?”
asked the girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no money, my dear; but if you like
I will mend your sleeve,” sadly returned the old
Mother, who was still holding the needle and thread
with which she had wanted to mend her son’s shirt.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the old Mother mended the girl’s sleeve,
and the girl gave her a bundle of kindling-wood,
thanked her kindly, and went on happy because
her shoulder was no longer cold.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>II</h3>

<p class='c011'>That evening the daughter-in-law said to the
Mother:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are going out to supper with godmother.
Mind you have hot water for me when I come back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The daughter-in-law was greedy and always on
the look-out to get invited for a meal.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the others went out, and the old woman was
left alone. She took out the kindling-wood which
the poor girl had given her, lit the fire on the hearth,
and went into the shed for wood.</p>

<p class='c009'>As she was in the shed fetching the wood, she
suddenly heard something in the kitchen a-bustling
and a-rustling—“hist, hist!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whoever is that?” called the old Mother
from the shed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Brownies! Brownies!” came the answer from
the kitchen in voices so tiny, for all the world like
sparrows chirping under the roof.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old woman wondered what on earth was
going on there in the dark, and went into the
kitchen. And when she got there the kindling-chips
just flared up on the hearth, and round the flame
there were Brownies dancing in a ring—all tiny
little men no bigger than half an ell. They wore
little fur coats; their caps and shoes were red as
flames; their beards were grey as ashes, and their
eyes sparkled like live coal.</p>

<p class='c009'>More and more of them danced out of the
flames, one for each chip. And as they appeared
they laughed and chirped, turned somersaults on
the hearth, twittered with glee, and then took hands
and danced in a ring.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id014'>
<img src='images/i171.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>And how they danced! Round the hearth, in
the ashes, under the cupboard, on the table, in the
jug, on the chair! Round and round! Faster and
faster! They chirped and they chattered, chased
and romped all over the place. They scattered the
salt; they spilt the barm; they upset the flour—all
for sheer fun. The fire on the hearth blazed and
shone, crackled and glowed; and the old woman
gazed and gazed. She never regretted the salt nor
the barm, but was glad of the jolly little folk whom
God had sent to comfort her.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed to the old woman as though she were
growing young again. She laughed like a dove; she
tripped like a girl; she took hands with the Brownies
and danced. But all the time there was the load on
her heart, and that was so heavy that the dance
stopped at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Little brothers,” said the Mother to the
Brownies, “can you not help me to get a sight of
my daughter-in-law’s tongue, so that when I can
show my son what I have seen with my own eyes
he will perhaps come to his senses?”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the old woman told the Brownies all that
had happened. The Brownies sat round the edge
of the hearth, their little feet thrust under the grate,
each wee mannikin beside his neighbour, and
listened to the old woman, all wagging their heads
in wonder. And as they wagged their heads, their
red caps caught the glow of the fire, and you’d
have thought there was nothing there but the fire
burning on the hearth.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the old woman had finished her story,
one of the Brownies called out, and his name was
Wee Tintilinkie:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will help you! I will go to the sunshiny
land and bring you magpies’ eggs. We will put
them under the sitting hen, and when the magpies
are hatched your daughter-in-law will betray herself.
She will crave for little magpies like any
ordinary forest snake, and so put out her tongue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All the Brownies twittered with joy because
Wee Tintilinkie had thought of something so clever.
They were still at the height of their glee when in
came the daughter-in-law from supper with a cake
for herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>She flew to the door in a rage to see who was
chattering in the kitchen. But just as she opened
the door, the door went bang! the flame leapt,
up jumped the Brownies, gave one stamp all round
the hearth with their tiny feet, rose up above the
flames, flew up to the roof,—the boards in the roof
creaked a bit, and the Brownies were gone!</p>

<p class='c009'>Only Wee Tintilinkie did not run away, but
hid among the ashes.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the flame leapt so unexpectedly and the
door banged to, the daughter-in-law got a start,
so that for sheer fright she plumped on the floor
like a sack. The cake broke in her hand; her hair
came down, combs and all; her eyes goggled, and she
called out angrily:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was that, you old wretch?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The wind blew up the flame when the door
opened,” said the Mother, and kept her wits about
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what is that among the ashes?” said the
daughter-in-law again. For from the ashes peeped
the red heel of Wee Tintilinkie’s shoe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is a live ember,” said the Mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, the daughter-in-law would not believe
her, but, all dishevelled as she was, she got up and
went over to see close to what was on the hearth.
As she bent down with her face over the ashes Wee
Tintilinkie quickly let out with his foot, so that his
heel caught the daughter-in-law on the nose. The
Woman screamed as if she were drowning in the
sea; her face was all over soot, and her tumbled hair
all smothered with ashes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was that, you miserable old woman?”
hissed the daughter-in-law.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A chestnut bursting in the fire,” answered
the Mother; and Wee Tintilinkie in the ashes almost
split with laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the daughter-in-law went out to wash,
the Mother showed Wee Tintilinkie where the
daughter-in-law had set the hen, so as to have little
chickens for Christmas. That very night Wee
Tintilinkie fetched magpies’ eggs and put them
under the hen instead of hens’ eggs.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>III</h3>

<p class='c011'>The daughter-in-law bade the Mother take good
care of the hen and to tell her at once whenever
the chickens were hatched. Because the daughter-in-law
intended to invite the whole village to come
and see that she had chickens at Christmas, when
nobody else had any.</p>

<p class='c009'>In due time the magpies were hatched. The
Mother told her daughter-in-law that the chickens
had come out, and the daughter-in-law invited the
village. Gossips and neighbours came along, both
great and small, and the old woman’s son was there
too. The Wife told her mother-in-law to fetch the
nest and bring it into the passage.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Mother brought in the nest, lifted off the
hen, and behold, there was something chirping in
the nest. The naked magpies scrambled out, and
hop, hop, hopped all over the passage.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the Snake-Woman so unexpectedly caught
sight of <i>magpies</i>, she betrayed herself. Her serpent’s
nature craved its prey; she darted down the passage
after the little magpies and shot out her thin quivering
tongue at them as she used to do in the Forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gossips and neighbours screamed and crossed
themselves, and took their children home, because
they realised that the woman was indeed a snake
from the Forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Mother went up to her son full of joy.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id015'>
<img src='images/i176a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Take her back to where you brought her from,
my son. Now you have seen with your own eyes
what it is you are cherishing in your house;” and
the Mother tried to embrace her son.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the son was utterly infatuated, so that he
only hardened himself the more against the village,
and against his Mother, and against the evidence of
his own eyes. He would not turn away the Snake-Woman,
but cried out upon his Mother:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where did you get young magpies at this time
of year, you old witch? Be off with you out of my
house!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eh, but the poor Mother saw that there was no
help for it. She wept and cried, and only begged
her son not to turn her out of the house in broad
daylight for all the village to see what manner of
son she had reared.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the son allowed his Mother to stay in the
house until nightfall.</p>

<p class='c009'>When evening came, the old Mother put some
bread into her bag, and a few of those kindling-chips
which the poor girl had given her, and then
she went weeping and sobbing out of her son’s house.</p>

<p class='c009'>But as the Mother crossed the threshold, the
fire went out on the hearth, and the crucifix fell
from the wall. Son and daughter-in-law were left
alone in the darkened cottage. And now the son
felt that he had sinned greatly against his Mother,
and he repented bitterly. But he did not dare to
speak of it to his wife, because he was afraid. So
he just said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s follow Mother and see her die of cold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Up jumped the wicked daughter-in-law, overjoyed,
and fetched their fur coats, and they dressed
and followed the old woman from afar.</p>

<p class='c009'>The poor Mother went sadly over the snow,
by night, over the fields. She came to a wide stubble-field,
and there she was so overcome by the cold
that she could go no farther. So she took the
kindling-wood out of her bag, scraped the snow aside,
and fit a fire to warm herself by.</p>

<p class='c009'>But lo! no sooner had the chips caught fire
than the Brownies came out of them, just the same
as on the household hearth!</p>

<p class='c009'>They skipped out of the fire and all round in
the snow, and the sparks flew about them in all
directions into the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>The poor old woman was so glad she could
almost have cried for joy because they had not forsaken
her on her way. And the Brownies crowded
round her, laughed and whistled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear Brownies,” said the Mother, “I
don’t want to be amused just now; help me in my
sore distress!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she told the Brownies how her silly son
had grown still more bitter against her since even
he and all the village had come to know that his
wife truly had a serpent’s tongue:</p>

<p class='c009'>“He has turned me away; help me if you
can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a while the Brownies were silent, for a while
their little shoes tapped the snow, and they did not
know what to advise.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last Wee Tintilinkie said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go to Stribor, our master. He always
knows what to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And at once Wee Tintilinkie shinned up a hawthorn-tree;
he whistled on his fingers, and out of
the dark and over the stubble-field there came
trotting towards them a stag and twelve squirrels!</p>

<p class='c009'>They set the old Mother on the stag, and the
Brownies got on the twelve squirrels, and off they
went to Stribor’s Forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Away and into the night they rode. The stag
had mighty antlers with many points, and at the
end of each point there burned a little star. The
stag gave light on the way, and at his heels sped the
twelve squirrels, each squirrel with eyes that shone
like two diamonds. They sped and they fled, and
far behind them toiled the daughter-in-law and her
husband, quite out of breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they came to Stribor’s Forest, and the stag
carried the old woman through the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even in the dark the daughter-in-law knew that
this was Stribor’s Forest, where she had once before
been enchanted for her sins. But she was so full
of spite that she could not think of her new sins
nor feel fear because of them, but triumphed all the
more to herself and said: “Surely the simple old
woman will perish in this Forest amid all the
magic!” and she ran still faster after the stag.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id016'>
<img src='images/i181.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>But the stag carried the Mother before Stribor.
Now Stribor was lord of that Forest. He dwelt in
the heart of the Forest, in an oak so huge that there
was room in it for seven golden castles, and a village
all fenced about with silver. In front of the finest
of the castles sat Stribor himself on a throne, arrayed
in a cloak of scarlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Help this old woman, who is being destroyed
by her serpent daughter-in-law,” said the Brownies
to Stribor, after both they and the Mother had
bowed low before him. And they told him the
whole story. But the son and daughter-in-law crept
up to the oak, and looked and listened through a
wormhole to see what would happen.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the Brownies had finished, Stribor said
to the old woman:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fear nothing, Mother! Leave your daughter-in-law.
Let her continue in her wickedness until it
shall bring her again to the state from which she freed
herself too soon. As for yourself, I can easily help you.
Look at yonder village, fenced about with silver.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Mother looked, and lo! it was her own
native village, where she had lived when she was
young, and in the village there was holiday and
merry-making. Bells were ringing, fiddles playing,
flags waving, and songs resounding.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cross the fence, clap your hands, and you
will at once regain your youth. You will remain
in your village to be young and blithe once more
as you were fifty years ago,” said Stribor.</p>

<p class='c009'>At that the old woman was glad as never before
in her life. She ran to the fence; already her hand
was on the silver gate, when she suddenly bethought
herself of something, and asked Stribor:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what will become of my son?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t talk foolishness, old woman!” replied
Stribor. “How would you know about your son?
He will remain in this present time, and you will
go back to your youth. You will know nothing about
any son!”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the old woman heard that, she considered
sadly. And then she turned slowly away from the gate,
went back to Stribor, bowed low before him, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you, kind lord, for all the favour you
would show me. But I would rather abide in my
misery and know that I have a son than that you
should give me all the riches and happiness in the
world and I forget my son.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the Mother said this, the whole Forest rang
again. There was an end to the magic in Stribor’s
Forest, because the Mother preferred her sorrows
to all the joys of this world.</p>

<p class='c009'>The entire Forest quaked, the earth fell in, and
the huge oak, with its castles and its silver-fenced
village, sank underground. Stribor and the Brownies
vanished, the daughter-in-law gave a shriek, turned
into a snake, wriggled away down a hole, and
Mother and Son were left alone side by side in the
middle of the Forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>The son fell on his knees before his mother,
kissed the hem of her garment and her sleeve, and
then he lifted her up in his arms and carried her
back to their home, which they happily reached by
daybreak.</p>

<p class='c009'>The son prayed God and his Mother to forgive
him. God forgave him, and his Mother had never
been angry with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later on the young man married that poor
but sweet girl who had brought the Brownies to
their house. They are all three living happily
together to this day, and Wee Tintilinkie loves to
visit their hearth of a winter’s evening.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c004'>Little Brother Primrose and Sister Lavender</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c007'>I</h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c012'>THE stronghold of a wise and noble
princess was attacked by her enemies.
The princess could not gather together
her large and faithful army quickly enough
to defend her castle, but had to fly by night with
her little prince in her arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>So she fled all through the night, and at daybreak
they reached the foot of grisly Mount Kitesh,
which was on the border of the principality.</p>

<p class='c009'>At that time there were no more dragons anywhere
in the world, nor fairies, nor witches, nor any
monsters. The Holy Cross and human reason had
driven them forth. But in the fastnesses of Mount
Kitesh the last of the Fiery Dragons had found a
refuge, and seven Votaress Fairies attended upon
him. That is why Mount Kitesh was so grisly.
But at the foot of the mountain lay a quiet valley.
There dwelt the shepherdess Miloika in her little
willow cabin, and tended her flock.</p>

<p class='c009'>To that very valley came the princess at dawn
with her baby, and when she saw Miloika sitting
outside her cabin she went up to her and begged:
“Hide me and the little prince in your cabin through
the day. At nightfall I will continue my flight
with the prince.” Miloika made the fugitives welcome,
gave them ewes’ milk to drink, and hid them in
her cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>As evening approached, the kind and noble
princess said: “I must go on now with the prince.
But will you take my Golden Girdle and the prince’s
little Gold Cross on a red ribbon? If our enemies
should chance to find us they would know us by the
Girdle and the Cross. Put these two things by and
take good care of them in your little cabin. When
my faithful captains have gathered together an army
and driven out the enemy, I shall return to my castle
and there you shall be my dear friend and companion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your companion I cannot be, noble princess,”
said Miloika, “for I am not your equal either by
birth or understanding. But I will take care of your
Girdle and your Cross, because in time of real
sorrow and trouble even the heart of a beggar can
be companion to the heart of a king.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As she said this, Miloika received the Girdle
and the Cross from the princess for safe keeping,
and the princess took up the little prince and went
out and away with him into the night, which was so
dark that you could not tell grass from stone, nor
field from sea.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>II</h3>

<p class='c011'>Many years passed, but the princess did not
return to her lands nor to her castle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her great army and her illustrious captains were
so disloyal that they all immediately went over to
her enemies. And so the enemy conquered the lands
of the good and noble princess, and settled down
in her castle.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one knew or could discover what had
become of the princess and the little prince. Most
probably her escape on that dark night had ended
by her falling into the sea, or over a precipice, or
perishing in some other way with her baby.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Miloika the shepherdess faithfully kept the
Golden Girdle of the princess and the prince’s
little Gold Cross.</p>

<p class='c009'>The smartest and wealthiest swains of the
village came to ask Miloika to marry them, because
the Golden Girdle and the little Gold Cross on the
red ribbon were worth as much as ten villages.
But Miloika would have none of them for her
husband, saying: “You come because of the Golden
Girdle and the little Cross; but they are not mine,
and I must take better care of them than of my
sheep or my cabin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So said Miloika, and chose a penniless and
gentle youth to be her husband, who cared nothing
about the Girdle and Cross of Gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>They lived in great poverty, and at times there
was neither bread nor meal in the house, but
they never thought of selling either Girdle or
Cross.</p>

<p class='c009'>Within a few years Miloika’s husband fell ill
and died; and not long afterwards a sore sickness
came upon Miloika, and she knew that she too must
die. So she called her two children, her little
daughter Lavender and her still smaller son Primrose,
and gave them each a keepsake. Round
Lavender’s waist she bound the Golden Girdle,
and round Primrose’s neck she hung the Gold Cross
on the red ribbon. And Miloika said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Farewell, my children! You will be left alone
in this world, and I have taught you but little craft
or skill; but with God’s help, what I have taught
you will just suffice for your childish needs. Cleave
to one another, and guard as a sacred trust what
your mother gave into your keeping, and then I
shall always remain with you.” Thus spoke the
mother, and died.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lavender and Primrose were so little that they
did not know how their mother had come by the
Girdle and Cross, and still less did they understand
the meaning of their mother’s words. But they just
sat side by side by their dead mother like two poor
little orphans and waited to see what would become
of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently the good folk of the village came
along and said that Miloika would have to be buried
next day.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>III</h3>

<p class='c011'>But that was not the only thing that happened
next day. For when the people came back from
the funeral, they all went into the house to gossip,
and only Lavender and Primrose remained outside,
because they still fancied that their mother would
yet somehow come back to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly a huge Eagle pounced down upon
them from the sky, knocked Lavender down,
caught her by the Girdle with his talons, and carried
her off into the clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Eagle flew away with Lavender to his eyrie,
high up on Mount Kitesh.</p>

<p class='c009'>It did not hurt Lavender at all to fly along like
that, hanging by her Gold Girdle. She was only
sorry at being parted from her only brother, and
kept on thinking: “Why didn’t the Eagle take
Primrose too!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they flew over Mount Kitesh, and there,
all of a sudden, Lavender saw what neither she
nor anyone else of the inhabitants of the valley
had ever seen; for everyone avoided the grisly
mountains, and of those who had happened to
stray into them not one had ever returned. What
Lavender saw was this: all the seven Votaress Fairies
who waited upon the Fiery Dragon assembled
together upon a rock. They called themselves
<i>Votaresses</i> because they had vowed, as the last of the
fairy kin, to take vengeance upon the human race.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Fairies looked up, and there was the eagle
carrying a little girl. Now the Fairies and the Eagles
had made a bargain between them that each should
bring his prey to that rock, and there hold a prizecourt
upon the rock to settle what was to be done
with the prey and who was to have it. And for that
reason the rock was called <i>Share-spoil</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the Fairies called out to the Eagle:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ho, brother Klickoon! come and alight on
Share-spoil!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But luckily the bargain was no sounder than
the parties to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Eagle Klickoon had taken a fancy to
Lavender, so he did not keep to the bargain, nor
would he alight on Share-spoil, but carried Lavender
on to his eyrie for his eaglets to play with.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he had to fly right across the summit of the
Mountain, because his eyrie was on the far side.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, on the top of the Mountain there was a
lake, and in the lake there was an island, and on
the island there was a little old chapel. Around the
lake was a tiny meadow, and all round the meadow
ran a furrow ploughed in days of old. Across this
furrow neither the Dragon, nor the Fairies, nor any
monster of the Mountain could pass. About the
lake bloomed flowers, and spread their perfume;
there doves took refuge, and nightingales, and all
gentle creatures from the mountains.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id017'>
<img src='images/i195.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>Neither clouds nor mist hung over the holy
furrow-surrounded Lake; but evermore the sun and
moon in turn shed their light upon it.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Klickoon flew over the Lake with Lavender,
she caught sight of the chapel. And as she caught
sight of the chapel, she remembered her mother;
and as she remembered her mother, she pressed her
hand to her heart; and as she pressed her hand to
her heart, her mother’s trust, the Golden Girdle,
came undone upon Lavender.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Girdle came undone; Lavender dropped
from the Eagle’s talons straight into the Lake, and
the Girdle after her. Lavender caught hold of the
Golden Girdle and stepped over the reeds, and
the water-lilies, and the water-weeds, and the rushes
to the island. There she sat down on a stone outside
the chapel. But Klickoon flew on like a whirlwind
in a rage, because he could not come near
the Holy Lake.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lavender was safe enough now, for nothing
evil could reach her across the furrow. But what
was the good of that, when the poor little child was
all alone on the top of the grisly Mount Kitesh, and
none could come to her, and she could not get away?</p>
<h3 class='c007'>IV</h3>

<p class='c011'>Meantime the people who had buried Miloika
noticed that the Eagle had carried off Lavender. At
first they all burst out lamenting, but then one of
them said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good people, it is really as well that the Eagle
carried off Lavender. It would have been hard to
find someone in the village who could take charge
of the <i>two</i> children. But for Primrose alone we shall
easily find someone who will look after him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes,” the others all immediately agreed,
“it is better so. We can easily look after Primrose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They stood yet awhile outside the cabin gazing
in the direction towards which the Eagle had disappeared
with Lavender into the skies, and then
they went back indoors to drink and to talk, repeating
all the time:</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s not one of us but will be glad to take
Primrose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they said. But not one of them troubled
so much about Primrose as to offer him a drink of
water, although it was very hot. Now Primrose was
thirsty and went in to ask for water. But he was
so tiny that not one of those people could understand
what he said. Primrose wanted someone to
get him his little wooden mug; but not one of
those people knew that Primrose’s little wooden mug
was behind the beam.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Primrose saw all this, he looked round
the room for a moment, and then the child thought:
“This is no good to me. I am left all alone in the
world.” So he leaned over the pitcher that stood
on the floor, drank as much water as he could, and
then set out to see if he could find his little sister
Lavender.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went out of the house and set off towards
the sun—the direction in which he had seen the
Eagle fly away with Lavender.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>V</h3>

<p class='c011'>The sun was setting beyond Mount Kitesh,
and so Primrose, always looking at the sun, presently
came to Mount Kitesh, too. There was no one
beside Primrose to say to him: “Don’t go up the
Mountain, child! The Mountain is full of terrors.”
And so he went on, poor, foolish baby, and began
to climb up the Mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Primrose did not know what fear was. His
mother had kept him safe like a flower before the
altar, so that no harm, not even the smallest, had
ever befallen him; he had never been pricked by
a thorn, nor scared by a harsh word.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so no fear could enter Primrose’s heart,
no matter what his eyes beheld or his ears heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meantime, Primrose had got well up into the
Mountain and already reached the first rocks and
crags.</p>

<p class='c009'>And there, below Share-spoil, the Votaress Fairies
were all assembled and still discussing how Klickoon
had cheated them. Suddenly they saw a child
coming towards them, climbing up the Mountain.
The Votaresses were delighted; it would be easy
to deal with such a little child!</p>

<p class='c009'>As Primrose came nearer, the Votaresses went
down to meet him. In less than no time they had
surrounded him. Primrose only wondered when
he suddenly saw so many ladies coming towards
him, each with a great pair of wings! One of the
Votaresses went close up to the child to take him
by the hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Primrose was wearing the little Cross
round his neck. When the Fairy saw the Cross,
she screamed and started away from Primrose, for
she could not touch him because of the Cross.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Fairies had no intention of letting the
child off so easily. They hovered about him in a
wide circle and conferred softly about what was to
be done with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Little Primrose’s heart was untroubled within
him. The Fairies conferred, and their thoughts
were so black that they came out in a cloud of black
forest wasps buzzing round their heads. But Primrose
just looked at them, and as he could see no
harm in them, how was he to be frightened? On
the contrary, the wings of one of the Votaresses took
his fancy, flapping like that, and so he toddled up
to her to see what she was really like.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will do nicely,” thought the Votaress.
“I cannot touch him, but I will entice him into the
Wolf’s Pit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For near by there was a pit all covered over with
boughs, so that you could not see it; and the bottom
of the pit was full of horrible stakes and spikes.
Whoever stepped on the boughs was bound to fall
through and kill himself on the spikes.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the Votaress Fairy enticed Primrose to the
Wolf’s Pit, always slipping away from him, and he
always following to see what her wings really were.
And so they came to the Pit. The Fairy flew over
the Pit; but poor little misguided Primrose stepped
on the boughs and fell down the hole.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Votaresses shrieked for joy, and hurried
up to see the child perish on the spikes.</p>

<p class='c009'>But what do Fairies know about a baby!</p>

<p class='c009'>Primrose was light as a chicken. Some of the
boughs and branches fell down with him, the
branches covered the spikes, and Primrose was so
small and light that he came to rest upon the leaves
as if they had been a bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Primrose found himself lying down upon
something soft, he thought: “I suppose I had
better go to sleep!” So he tucked his little hand
under his head and went sound asleep, never thinking
that he was caught in a deep hole and could not
get out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Round him there were still many bare spikes,
and the wicked Fairies were bending over the Pit.
But Primrose slept peacefully and quietly, as though
he were bedded on sweet basil. Primrose never
moved. His mother had taught him: “When you
are in your bed, darling, shut your little eyes and lie
quite still, so as not to frighten your guardian angel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So the Fairies stood round the Pit, and saw
the baby falling asleep like a little duke in his golden
crib. “That child is not so easy to deal with, after
all,” said the Votaresses. So they flew off to
Share-spoil, and took counsel as to how they might
kill him, since they could not touch him because
of the little Cross.</p>

<p class='c009'>They argued and argued, and at last one of
the Votaresses had an idea. “We will raise a
storm,” said she; “we will cause a terrific rain. A
torrent will pour down the Mountain, and the child
will be drowned in the Pit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whoo-ee, whoo-ee!” howled the Votaresses.
They flapped their wings for joy, and at once rose
up into the air and above the Mountain to roll up
the clouds and raise a storm.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>VI</h3>

<p class='c011'>Little Lavender was sitting on the top of the
Mountain on her island in the Holy Lake. Round
her fluttered lovely butterflies, even settling on her
shoulders; and the grey dove guided her young to
her lap to let her feed them with seeds. A wild
raspberry-cane bent over Lavender, and Lavender
ate the crimson fruit, and wanted for nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>But she was all alone, poor child! and sad at
heart, because she believed she was parted for ever
from Primrose, her only brother; and, moreover, she
thought: “Did anyone, I wonder, remember to
give him a drink or to put him to bed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the midst of these sad thoughts Lavender
looked up at the sky and saw a mist, black as night,
rolling up round the Mountain. Over Lavender
and over the holy furrow-surrounded Lake the sun
shone brightly; but all around the mist was gathering
and rising, inky clouds drifted and whirled, rose
and fell like a pall of smoke, and every now and
again fiery flashes darted from the gloom.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the Votaresses, flapping their great
wings, who had piled up those black clouds upon
the Mountain, and it was from their eyes that the
fiery flashes shot across the darkness. And then
suddenly it began to thunder most terribly within
the clouds; heavy rain beat down all around upon
the Mountain, and the Votaresses howled and darted
to an fro through the thunder and the rain.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Lavender saw that, she considered:
“Over my head there is sunshine, and no harm can
come to me. But perhaps there is someone abroad
on the Mountain in need of help in this storm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And although Lavender thought there was never
a Christian soul on the Mountain, yet she did as
her mother had taught her to do in a storm: she
crossed herself and prayed. And as there was still
a bell in the ruined chapel, Lavender took hold of
the rope and began to toll the bell against the storm.
Lavender did not know for whom she was praying
or for whom she was tolling, but she tolled for a
help to anyone who might be in distress.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the bell on the island began to ring so
unexpectedly, after having been silent for a hundred
years, the Votaresses took fright up there in the
clouds; they got worried and confused; they left
off making a storm; they fled in terror in all
directions, and hid under the rocks, under the crags,
in hollow trees, or in the fern.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a little while the Mountain was clear, and
the sun shone on the Mountain, where there had
been no sunshine for a hundred years.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun shone; the rain stopped suddenly. But
for poor little Primrose the danger was not yet over.</p>

<p class='c009'>That first great downpour had formed a big
torrent in the Mountain, and the wild water was
rushing fast towards the very Pit where Primrose
was sleeping.</p>

<p class='c009'>Primrose had heard neither the storm nor the
thunder, and now he did not hear the torrent either
as it came rushing and roaring with frightful swiftness
towards him to drown him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The water poured into the Pit, poured in, and
in a moment it had overwhelmed the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>It covered him, overwhelmed him in a moment.
There was not a thing to be seen, neither Pit, nor
spikes, nor Primrose, nothing but the wild water
foaming down the Mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>But as the flood rushed into the pit, it eddied
at the bottom, surged round and up and back upon
itself, and then suddenly the water lifted up the
boughs and branches, and little Primrose, too, upon
the boughs. It lifted him up, clean out of the Pit,
and carried him downhill on a bough.</p>

<p class='c009'>The torrent was so strong that it carried away
great stones and ancient oaks, rolling them along,
and nothing could stop them, because they were
heavy and stout, and the torrent very fierce.</p>

<p class='c009'>But tiny Primrose on his bough floated lightly
down the flood, as lightly as a white rose-bud, so
that any bush could stop him.</p>

<p class='c009'>And indeed, there was a bush in the way, and
the bough with Primrose caught in its branches.
Primrose woke up with a start, caught hold of the
branch with his little hands, climbed up into the
bush, and there he sat on the top of the bush, just
like a little bird.</p>

<p class='c009'>Above Primrose the sun shone clear and sweet;
below Primrose foamed the dreadful water; and he sat
in the bush in his little white shirt, and rubbed his eyes
in wonder, because he could not make out what had
happened and what had waked him up so suddenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time he had finished rubbing his eyes
the water had all run away downhill; the torrent
was gone. Primrose watched the mud squelching
and writhing round the bush, and then Primrose
climbed down, because he thought:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose I ought to go on now, since they
have waked me up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And so he went on up the hill. And he had
slept so sweetly that he felt quite happy, and thought:
“Now I shall find Lavender.”</p>
<h3 class='c007'>VII</h3>

<p class='c011'>No sooner had the bell stopped ringing than
the Votaresses recovered their strength. They took
courage and crept out of their hidie-holes. When
they got out, lo! the sun was shining on the
Mountain, and there is nothing in the world the
wicked Fairies fear more than the sunlight. And as
they could not wrap the whole Mountain in mist
all in a hurry, each one quickly rolled herself up in
a bit of fog, and off they flew to the Pit to make
sure that Primrose was drowned.</p>

<p class='c009'>But when they got there and looked into the Pit,
the Pit was empty; Primrose was gone!</p>

<p class='c009'>The Fairies cried aloud with vexation, and looked
all over the Mountain to see whether the water had
not dashed him against a stone. But as the Votaresses
looked, why, this is what they saw: Primrose going
blithely on his way; the sun was drying his little
shirt for him on his back, and he was crooning away
to himself as little children will.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That child will escape us at this rate,” sobbed
one of the Votaresses. “The child is stronger than
we are. Hadn’t we better ask the Fiery Dragon to
help us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t disgrace yourselves, my sisters,” said
another Votaress. “Surely we can get the better
of a feeble infant by ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So said the Fairy, but she did not know that
Primrose in his simplicity was stronger than all the
evil and all the cunning in Mount Kitesh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will send the She-bear to kill the child
for us,” suggested a Votaress. “Dumb animals do
not fear the Cross.” And she flew off at once to the
bears’ den.</p>

<p class='c009'>There lay the She-bear, a-playing with her cub.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run along, Bruineen, down that path. There
is a child coming up the path. Wait for him and kill
him, Bruineen dear,” said the Votaress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t leave my cub,” answered Bruineen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll amuse him for you,” said the Votaress,
and straightway began to play with the little bear.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bruineen went away down the path, and there
was Primrose already in sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>The great She-bear rose up on her hind-legs,
stretched out her front paws, and so went forwards
towards Primrose to kill him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The She-bear was terrible to see, but Primrose
saw nothing terrible in her, and could only think:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s somebody coming and offering me his
hand, so I must give him mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Primrose raised both his little hands and
held them out to the She-bear, and went straight
up to her, as though his mother had called him to
her arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, another moment, and the dreadful She-bear
would seize him. She had come up to him,
and would have caught and killed him at once had
he offered to run. But she saw that she had time to
consider how she had best take hold of him. So
she drew herself right up, looked at Primrose from
the right and from the left, and now she was going
to pounce.</p>

<p class='c009'>But at that very moment the little bear cub in
the den began to squeal. One of the black wasps that
always buzzed round the Votaress’s head had stung
him. The cub howled lustily, because, although
the Bruins are a spiteful folk themselves, they won’t
stand spite from anybody else. So the cub squealed
at the top of his voice, and when Bruineen heard
her baby crying she forgot about Primrose and the
Mountain! Bruineen dropped on all-fours and
trundled away like fury to her den.</p>

<p class='c009'>The angry She-bear caught the Votaress by the
hair with her great paw. They fought, they rolled,
they tore at each other, and left Primrose in peace.</p>

<p class='c009'>Primrose followed the She-bear and looked on
for a bit while they fought and scuffled; he looked,
and then he laughed aloud, silly baby! and went
on up the Mountain, and never knew what a narrow
escape he had had!</p>
<h3 class='c007'>VIII</h3>

<p class='c011'>Once more the Votaresses assembled on Share-spoil
to discuss what was to be done about Primrose.
They saw that they were weaker than he.</p>

<p class='c009'>Moreover, they were getting tired of flying to
Share-spoil and back and conferring about Primrose,
and so they were very angry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we will poison the child. Neither spells
nor cunning shall help him now,” they resolved.
And straightaway one of them took a wooden platter
and hurried off to a certain meadow in the Mountain
to gather poison berries.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Primrose, never dreaming that anybody
should be talking about him or worrying their brains
about him, walked gaily over the Mountain, cooing
softly to himself like a little dove.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently he came to the poison meadow. The
path led through the middle of it. On one side of
the path the meadow was covered with red berries
and on the other side with black. Both were
poisonous, and whoever ate of either the one or the
other was sure to die.</p>

<p class='c009'>But how was Primrose to know that there was
such a thing as poison in the world, when he had
never known any food but what his mother gave
him?</p>

<p class='c009'>Primrose was hungry, and he liked the look of
the red berries in the meadow. But he saw someone
over there in front of him on the red side picking
berries and seemingly in a great hurry, for she never
raised her head. It was the Votaress, and she was
gathering red berries to poison Primrose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is her side,” thought Primrose, and went
over to the black berries, because he had never been
taught to take what belonged to another. So he sat
down among the black berries and began to eat;
and the Fairy wandered far away among the red
berries and never noticed that Primrose had already
come up and was eating black ones.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Primrose had eaten enough he got up to
go on. But, oh dear! a mist rose before his eyes;
his head began to ache most dreadfully, and the
earth seemed to rock beneath his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>That was because of the black poison.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor little Primrose! indeed you know neither
spells nor cunning, and how are you going to save
yourself from this new danger?</p>

<p class='c009'>But Primrose struggled on all the same, because
he thought it was nothing that a mist should rise
before his eyes and the ground rock beneath his
feet!</p>

<p class='c009'>And so he came up with the Fairy where she
was picking berries. The Votaress caught sight of
Primrose, and at once she ran on to the path in
front of him with her plateful of red berries. She
laid down the platter before him and invited him
by signs to eat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Votaress did not know that Primrose had
already eaten of the black berries; and if she had
known, she would never have offered him red
ones, but would have let him die of the black
poison.</p>

<p class='c009'>Primrose did not care for any more berries,
because his head ached cruelly; but his mother
used to say to him: “Eat, darling, when I offer
you something, and don’t grieve your mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now this was neither spell nor cunning what
Primrose had been taught by his mother. But it
was in a good hour that Primrose did as his mother
had taught him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He took the plate and ate of the red berries;
and as he ate, the mist cleared before his eyes, his
head and his heart stopped aching, and the ground
no longer rocked beneath his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>The red poison killed the black in Primrose’s
veins. He merrily clapped his hands and went on
his way as sound as a bell and as happy as a
grig.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now he could see the top of the Mountain
ahead of him, and Primrose thought:</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is the end of the world. There is
nothing beyond the top. There I shall find
Lavender.”</p>
<h3 class='c007'>IX</h3>

<p class='c011'>The Votaress would not believe her eyes; she
stared after Primrose, and there was he toddling
along and the dreadful poison doing him no harm!</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked and she looked—and then she
shrieked with rage. She could not imagine by what
miracle Primrose had escaped. All she could see
was that the child would slip through her hands and
reach the Lake, for he was getting near the top.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Votaress had no time to fly to Share-spoil
and confer with her sisters. In time of real trouble
people don’t hold conferences. But she flew straight
to her brother, the thunder-voiced bird Belleroo.</p>

<p class='c009'>Belleroo’s nest was in a little bog on the Mountain,
close to the furrow which ran round the Holy
Lake. As he was an ill-tempered bird, he too could
not cross the furrow, but the evil Things of the
Mountain had appointed his place here on the
boundary, so that he might trouble the peace of the
Lake with his booming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kinsman, brother, Belleroo,” the Votaress cried
out to Belleroo, “there is a child coming up the path.
Delay him here at the furrow with your booming,
so that he may not escape me across the farrow to
the Lake. I am going for the Fiery Dragon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>No sooner had the Votaress said this than she
flew like an arrow down the Mountain to fetch the
Fiery Dragon, who was lying asleep in a deep gully.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Belleroo, he was always all impatience
to be told to boom, because he was horribly proud
of his loud voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dusk was beginning to fall. It was evening.
Nearer and nearer to the furrow came Primrose.
Beyond the furrow he could see the Lake, and the
chapel looming white on the Lake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here I am at the end of the world; I have
only to cross that furrow,” thought Primrose.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly the Mountain rang with the most
awful noise, so that the branches swayed and the
leaves trembled on the trees, and the rocks and
cliffs re-echoed down to the deepest cavern. It was
Belleroo roaring.</p>

<p class='c009'>His boom was terrible. It would have scared
the great Skanderbeg himself, for it would have
reminded Skanderbeg of the boom of the Turkish
guns.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it did not in the least frighten the little
innocent Primrose, who had never yet been shouted
at in grief or anger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Primrose heard something making such a noise
that the very Mountain shook, and so he went up to
see what great thing it might be. When he got there,
lo! it was a bird no bigger than a hen!</p>

<p class='c009'>The bird dipped its beak in a pool, then threw
up its head and puffed out its throat like a pair of
bellows, and boomed—heavens, it boomed so that
Primrose’s sleeves fluttered on him! This new
wonder took Primrose’s fancy so much that he sat
down so as to see from near by how Belleroo boomed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Primrose sat down just below the holy furrow
beside Belleroo, and peered under his throat—because
by now it was dark—the better to see how Belleroo
puffed out his throat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Had Primrose been wiser he would not have
lingered there on the Mountain just below the
furrow, where every evil Thing could hurt him,
but he would have taken that one step across the
furrow so as to be safe where the evil Things could
not come.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Primrose was just a little simpleton, and
might easily have come to grief just there, within
sight of safety.</p>

<p class='c009'>Primrose was much amused by Belleroo.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was amused; he was beguiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>And while he was amusing himself in this fashion,
the Fairy went and roused the Fiery Dragon where
he slept in a deep gully.</p>

<p class='c009'>She roused him and led him up the Mountain.
On came the fearsome Fiery Dragon, spouting flame
out of both nostrils and crushing firs and pine-trees
as he went. There wasn’t room enough for him,
you see, in the forest and the Mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why don’t you run, little Primrose? One jump
across the furrow, and you will be safe and happy!</p>

<p class='c009'>But Primrose did not think of running away.
He went on sitting quite calmly below the furrow,
and when he saw the flames from the Dragon flaring
up in the darkness, he thought to himself: “What
is making that pretty light on the Mountain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a cruel fire coming along to devour
Primrose, and he, foolish baby! sat looking at it,
all pleased and wondering: “What is making that
pretty light on the Mountain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Votaress caught sight of Primrose, and said
to the Fiery Dragon:</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is the child. Fiery Dragon! Get your
best fire ready!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Dragon was panting with the stiff climb.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait a moment, sister, while I get my breath,”
answered the Dragon.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the Dragon took a deep breath, once, twice,
three times!</p>

<p class='c009'>But that is just where the Dragon made a mistake.</p>

<p class='c009'>Because his mighty breath caused an equally
great wind on the Mountain. The wind blew, and
bowled Primrose over the furrow and right up to
the Holy Lake!</p>

<p class='c009'>The Votaress gave one shriek, threw herself
down on the ground, rolled herself up in her black
wings, and sobbed and cried like mad.</p>

<p class='c009'>The angry Dragon snorted and puffed; he
belched fire as from ten red-hot furnaces. But the
flames could not cross the furrow; when they reached
the furrow they just rose straight upwards as if they
had come up against a marble wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sparks and flame crackled and spurted and returned
upon Mount Kitesh. Half the Mountain
did the Dragon set on fire, but he lost little Primrose!</p>

<p class='c009'>When the wind bowled Primrose over like that,
Primrose only laughed at being carried away so fast.
He laughed once; he laughed twice....</p>
<h3 class='c007'>X</h3>

<p class='c011'>On the island in the Lake, beside the little chapel,
sat Lavender.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was evening, but Lavender could not go to
sleep because of the hurly-burly in the Mountain.
Lavender heard the Votaresses howling and shrieking
and Bruineen growling. She heard the Dragon come
snorting up from his lair, and saw him spout fire
all over the Mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now she saw the blazing flames shooting
upwards to the skies.</p>

<p class='c009'>But then she heard something—good gracious!
what was it she heard? A laugh, like a little silver
bell. Lavender’s heart throbbed within her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tiny voice laughed again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Lavender could bear it no longer, but
called from the Island:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is that laughing in the Mountain?” asked
Lavender gently, and all a-tremble at the thought
of <i>who</i> might answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is that calling me from the Island?”
answered little Primrose.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Lavender recognised Primrose’s baby-talk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Primrose! my own only Brother!” cried
Lavender, and stood up white in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lavender, little sister!” cried Primrose; and,
light as a moth, he stepped over the reeds and
the rushes and the water-weeds to the Island. They
hugged and they kissed; they sat down side by side
in the moonlight by the little chapel. A little did
they talk, but they were not clever at making a long
story. They clasped each other’s little hands and
went to sleep.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>XI</h3>

<p class='c011'>That was how they began to live day after day
on the Holy Lake. Primrose was quite happy and
desired nothing better.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was clear water in the Lake, and there
were sweet raspberries. There were plenty of flowers
and butterflies in the meadow, and fireflies and dew
by night. Nightingales and doves nested in the trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every evening Lavender would make Primrose
a bed of leaves, and in the morning she bathed him
in the Lake and tied up his little shoes. And Primrose
thought: “What do we want with a wider world
than this within the furrow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Primrose was well off; he was only a baby!</p>

<p class='c009'>And Lavender was happy, but she was troubled
about Primrose, how she should look after him and
get him food. Because God has so ordered it that
the young folk can never get food without the old
folk having to think about it.</p>

<p class='c009'>That is so all the world over, and couldn’t be
otherwise even on the Holy Lake.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Lavender was worried. “To-morrow will
be St. Peter’s Day. Will the raspberries be over
when St. Peter’s is past? Will the water grow cold
and the sun fail when autumn comes? How shall
we get through the winter all alone? Will our cottage
in the valley go to rack and ruin?”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Lavender worried, and wherever there is
worry, there temptation comes most easily.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day she sat and mused: “Oh dear! what
luck it would be if only we could get back to our
cottage!” Just then she heard somebody calling
from the Mountain. Lavender looked, and there
in the wood on the far side of the furrow stood the
youngest of the Votaresses.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was prettier than the other Votaresses, and
loved finery. She had noticed the Golden Girdle
on Lavender, and now she wanted that Golden
Girdle above anything else in the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Little girl, sister, throw me your Girdle,”
called the fairy across the furrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t do that, Fairy; I had that Girdle from
my mother,” answered Lavender.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Little girl, sister, it wasn’t your mother’s Girdle;
it belonged to the princess, and the princess has
been dead long ago. Throw me the Girdle,” said
the Fairy, who remembered the princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t, Fairy; the Girdle is from my mother,”
repeated Lavender.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Little girl, sister, I will carry you and your
brother down to the valley, and no harm shall come
to you; throw me the Girdle,” cried the Fairy once
more.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was a sad temptation for Lavender, who
so longed to get away from the Mountain! But
all the same she would not sacrifice her mother’s
keepsake to the greedy fairy, but answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot, Fairy; I had the Girdle from my
mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Fairy went away quite sadly, but next day
she came back and began again:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Throw me the Girdle, and I will take you
down the Mountain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot, Fairy; I had the Girdle from my
mother,” Lavender answered once more, but with
a very heavy heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>For seven days did the Fairy come, and for seven
days she tempted Lavender. Temptation is worse
than the sharpest care, and poor little Lavender
pined away, so great was her wish to get down to
the valley. Yet all the same she would not give up
the Girdle.</p>

<p class='c009'>For seven days did the Fairy call, and for seven
days did Lavender answer her:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot, Fairy; the Girdle is from my
mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And when she answered thus on the seventh
day, the Fairy saw that there was no help for it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Fairy went down the Mountain; she sat
down on the last, lowest stone, shook down her hair
and cried bitterly, so great was her desire for the
Golden Girdle of the princess.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>XII</h3>

<p class='c011'>Meantime the good and noble princess was not
dead, but had lived for many a year in a far country
with her son, the prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>The princess never told anybody how high-born
a lady she was, and her son was too young at the
time of their flight for him to remember.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so in that country not a soul knew—not
even the prince—that they came of royal blood.
But how could anybody tell that she was a princess,
when she had neither crown nor Golden Girdle?
And though she was good, gentle, and noble, that
did not prove that she was a princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>The princess lived in the house of a worthy
peasant, and there she span and wove for his
household.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this way she earned enough to keep herself
and her son.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy had grown up into a tall and handsome
youth of unusual strength and power, and the
princess taught him nothing that was not good and
right.</p>

<p class='c009'>But one thing was bad. The prince had a very
hasty and fierce temper. So the people called him
<i>Rowfoot Relya</i>, because he was so rough and strong—and
so poor withal.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day Rowfoot Relya was mowing his master’s
meadow, and lay down at noon in the shade to rest.
And a young squire came riding by, and called to
Relya:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hi, young man! jump up and run back along
the road and find me my silver spur; it fell off somewhere
on the way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Relya heard that, his princely blood, his
hot and hasty blood, was roused to evil within him
because the other had disturbed him in his rest and
would send him out to find his spur.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t I, by heaven!” cried Relya, “and you
can lie here and rest instead of me!” And with
that he sprang at the young squire, pulled him off
his horse, and flung him down in the shade, so that
he lay there for dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Rowfoot Relya, still furious, rushed home to
his mother, and cried out upon her:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wretched mother! why was I born a rowfoot
churl, for others to send me out to find their spurs
for them in the dust?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Relya’s face was quite distorted with rage as
he said this.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mother looked at her son, and her heart
grieved sorely. She saw that there would be no more
peace for her and her son, because she would have
to tell him what she had so far kept secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are not a rowfoot churl, my son,” replied
the princess, “but an unfortunate prince.” And
she told Relya all about herself and him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Relya listened; his eyes blazed with a strange
fire, and he clenched his hands in bitter anger. Then
he asked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there nothing left, then, mother, of our
lands?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing, my son, save a little Cross on a
red ribbon and a Golden Girdle,” answered his
mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Relya heard that, he cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am going, mother, and I shall bring back
that Cross and Girdle, wherever they may be!
Threefold will the sight of them increase my princely
strength!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And then he asked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And where did you leave the Cross and the
Girdle, mother? Did you leave them with the chief
of your captains for him and your great army to
guard?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my son,” replied the princess, “and it is
a good thing that I did not, for my captains and my
great army went over to the enemy, and are now
feasting and drinking with the enemy and wasting
my lands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you perhaps leave them in the lowest
room of your castle, in the seventh vault, under
seven locks?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my son, and it is a good thing that I
did not, because the enemy got into my castle,
broke open and ransacked its secret chambers,
searched its nine vaults, and fed his horses upon
pearls out of my treasure hoards,” replied the
princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But where did you leave the Golden Girdle
and the Cross on the red ribbon?” asked Relya,
with flashing eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I left them with a young shepherdess in a
willow cabin, where there are neither locks nor
strong boxes. Go, my son, perchance you will find
them there still.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Relya would not believe that the Girdle and
Cross might be safe in a willow cabin when the noble
princess’s pearls had not been safe even in the ninth
vault under her castle.</p>

<p class='c009'>But his princely blood, so proud and masterful,
was roused yet more to evil in Relya’s veins, and
he roughly said to his mother:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Farewell, then, mother! I shall find the Cross
and Girdle wherever they may be, and it shall be no
jesting matter for those who would refuse to let me
have them! I shall bring you back your Girdle and
Cross, by the princely blood in my veins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Prince Relya said this, he took the blade of
the scythe, fitted it with a mighty hilt at the forge,
and then hurried out into the world to find his
heritage. The earth rang beneath his feet; his hair
streamed in the wind, so swiftly did he stride;
and his murderous blade shone in the sun as though
it were plated with flame.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>XIII</h3>

<p class='c011'>So Relya went on without stopping. He strode
on by day, and by night he did not rest; both
great and small got out of his way.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is far to Mount Kitesh, but Relya had no
difficulty in finding out the way, because Mount
Kitesh was known throughout seven kingdoms for
its terrors.</p>

<p class='c009'>On St. John’s Day Relya bade farewell to his
mother, and on St. Peter’s Day he reached the foot
of the Mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he reached the foot of the Mountain, he
inquired after the willow cabin, the shepherdess
Miloika, and the Golden Girdle and Cross.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is the cabin in the valley. Miloika we
buried the first Sunday after Easter, and her children
have the Girdle and Cross. As for the children, the
Fairies have carried them off to Mount Kitesh,”
replied the villagers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Very wroth was Relya when he heard that the
Girdle and Cross had been carried off to Mount
Kitesh. He was so angry that he could not make
up his mind which to do first—hasten up the Mountain
or find out about the castle, since that was uppermost
in his desires.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And where is the princess’s castle?” shouted
Relya.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Over there, a day’s journey from here,”
answered the villagers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And how stands it with the castle?” asked
Relya, and his hand played with his sword. “Tell
me all you know about it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“None of us has been in the castle, because
the lords of it are hard of heart. Round the castle
they have placed mutes for guards and savage bloodhounds.
We cannot force our way past the bloodhounds,
and we do not know how to persuade the
guards,” answered the villagers. “And within the
castle are fine lords, drinking red wine in the halls,
playing upon silver lutes, and tossing golden balls
to each other over a silken carpet. In the outer
hall are two hundred workmen cutting hearts out
of mother-o’-pearl for targets for the lords. And
when the lords make a great feast, they load their
guns with precious stones and shoot at the hearts
of mother-o’-pearl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the villagers told him this, a mist swam
before Relya’s eyes, so furious was he when he heard
how wantonly the treasure in his mother’s vaults
was being squandered.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id018'>
<img src='images/i232a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>For a while Relya hesitated, and then he cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am going up the Mountain to win the Cross
and Girdle, and then I shall return to thee, O my
castle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus cried Relya; he made the sword sing
through the air above his head, and then strode
swiftly up into Mount Kitesh. There he found the
great Dragon asleep in the deep gully. You see,
the Dragon had tired himself out with belching so
much fire at Primrose, and now he had gone fast
asleep to gather fresh strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Relya was all impatience to fight someone so as
to cool his anger and to prove his strength. He was
tired of seeing everybody, both great and small, get out
of his way all the time, so now he rushed up to the
Fiery Dragon to rouse and dare him to mortal combat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Relya was a Doughty Hero, and the Fiery Dragon
was a Terrible Monster, and so their combat must be
sung in verse, beginning where Relya rushed up to
the Dragon:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Childe Relya smote the Dragon on the side</div>
      <div class='line'>With the flat blade, to rouse him from his sleep.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Beast looked up, raising his grisly head,</div>
      <div class='line'>Beheld the hero Relya standing by.</div>
      <div class='line'>Up leapt the Dragon, with a rending blow</div>
      <div class='line'>O’erturns the cliff and widens out the gap</div>
      <div class='line'>To make a fitting space wherein to fight!</div>
      <div class='line'>Anon unto the clouds he rears him up;</div>
      <div class='line'>Anon on Relya pounces from the clouds,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so with Relya joins in mortal fray.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now groans the earth and splits the solid rock.</div>
      <div class='line'>With tooth and flame the Dragon turns to bay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thrusts at Relya with his fiery head.</div>
      <div class='line'>But Relya waits him with a ready sword,</div>
      <div class='line'>And meets the onslaught with a ready sword;</div>
      <div class='line'>And with his weapon beating down the flame</div>
      <div class='line'>Seeks for the sword an undefended spot,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where he may smite the Dragon on the head.</div>
      <div class='line'>Deep bites the brand—so mighty was the shock</div>
      <div class='line'>That brand and bone no more will come apart.</div>
      <div class='line'>From dawn till noontide did the battle rage,</div>
      <div class='line'>And weaker grew the Dragon all the while,</div>
      <div class='line'>With brooding on the shame that galled his heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Because the babe, young Primrose, had escaped.</div>
      <div class='line'>And stronger grew Childe Relya all the while,</div>
      <div class='line'>For he did battle for his heritage.</div>
      <div class='line'>When at high noon the sun burned overhead,</div>
      <div class='line'>Childe Relya swung his gleaming brand aloft</div>
      <div class='line'>Towards the sun, and called on Heaven for aid.</div>
      <div class='line'>Down fell the sword betwixt the Dragon’s eyes—</div>
      <div class='line'>Full swiftly fell, yet lightly struck the blade,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet with such force, it cleft the Beast in twain.</div>
      <div class='line'>Into the hollow falls the Dragon, slain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And as stretched him in his dying spasm,</div>
      <div class='line'>The monstrous limbs block up the ancient chasm.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Thus did the doughty Relya overcome the Fiery
Dragon. But his brave arms and shoulders ached
terribly. So Relya said to himself: “I shall never
get over the Mountain at this rate. I must consider
what I had better do.” And Relya went back to the
foot of the Mountain, and there the hero sat down
on a stone and considered how he was to get across
the Mountain, and how he was to overcome the
monsters, and where he might find Miloika’s children
and with them the Golden Girdle and Cross.</p>

<p class='c009'>Relya was deep in thought, but all of a sudden
he heard somebody weeping and sobbing near him.
Relya turned, and there was a Fairy sitting on a
stone, her hair all unbound, and crying her heart
out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What ails you, pretty maiden? Why do you
weep?” asked Relya.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I weep, O hero, because I cannot get the Golden
Girdle from the child on the Lake,” answered the
Fairy.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Relya heard that he was overjoyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me, maiden, how can I get to that Lake?”
asked Relya.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And who may you be, unknown hero?” returned
the Fairy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am Prince Relya, and I seek a Golden Girdle
and a Cross on a red ribbon,” replied Relya.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the Fairy heard that, she thought within
her evil heart: “How lucky for me! Let Relya
get the Girdle away from the Lake and on to the
Mountain, and I will soon destroy Relya and keep
the Girdle for myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So the cunning Fairy spoke these honeyed words
to Relya:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us go, noble Prince! I will guide you
across the Mountain. No harm will come to you,
and I will show you where the children are. Why
should you not have what is yours by inheritance?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus sweetly did the Fairy speak, but in her heart
she thought otherwise. Relya, however, was mightily
pleased, and at once agreed to go with the Fairy.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they went across the Mountain. Neither
Fairies nor monsters touched Relya, because he was
being guided by the young Votaress Fairy.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the way the Fairy advised Relya and tried
to fill his heart with anger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You should but see, noble Prince, how insolent
these children are! Not even to you will they give
the Girdle. But you are a hero above all heroes,
Relya, so do not let them put you to shame.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Relya laughed at the idea that two children
should withstand him—<i>him</i> who had cleft in twain
the Fiery Dragon!</p>

<p class='c009'>The Fairy then went on to tell him how the
children had come up into the Mountain, and how
they did not know how to get away from it again.</p>

<p class='c009'>In her joy at the prospect of getting the Girdle,
the Fairy talked so much that her cunning deserted
her, and she chattered to Relya and boasted to him
of her knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are silly children, without any cunning.
Yet if they knew what <i>we</i> know they would have
escaped us already. There is a taper in the chapel
and a censer. If they would start the fire that is not
lit with hands, and then light the taper and censer,
they could go with taper and censer across the whole
Mountain as if it were a church. Paths would open
before them and trees bow down as they passed.
But for us this would be the worst thing possible,
because all we Fairies and Goblins in Mount Kitesh
would perish wherever the smoke from the taper and
censer spread. But what do these silly, insolent
children know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>If the Votaress had not been so overjoyed, she
would surely never have told Relya about the taper
and censer, but would have kept the secret of the
Votaresses.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they came to the furrow, and there was the
Holy Lake before them.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>XIV</h3>

<p class='c011'>The Prince peered cautiously from behind a
tree, and the Fairy pointed out the children to him.
Relya saw the little chapel on the island. Before the
chapel sat a little girl, pale as a white rose. She
neither sang nor crooned, but sat still with her hands
clasped in her lap and her eyes raised to heaven.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the sand beside the chapel played a little boy,
baby Primrose, and round his neck hung a little
Gold Cross.</p>

<p class='c009'>He played on the sand, built castles and pulled
them down again with his tiny hands, and then laughed
at his handiwork.</p>

<p class='c009'>Relya watched, and as he watched he began
to think. But the Votaress had no time to wait while
the Prince finished thinking things out, so she softly
prompted Relya.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will call to the little girl, noble Prince, and
you shall see that she will not give up the Girdle;
then do you draw your burnished sword, go up
and take what is yours, and then come back to me
to the Mountain, and I will guide you back down
the Mountain so that my sisters shall not hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the Fairy said this, she secretly rejoiced,
thinking how easily she would kill Relya and get
the Girdle for herself, so long as Relya would bring
it from the Lake. But Relya only listened with half
an ear to what the Votaress was saying, for he was
lost in looking at the girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Fairy called to Lavender:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Little girl, sister, throw me the Girdle, and
I will take you and your brother down the Mountain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Lavender heard this, her face grew yet
paler, and she clasped her little hands yet more
tightly. She was so sad that she could scarcely speak.
She would so gladly have left the Mountain; her
little heart was bursting with longing.</p>

<p class='c009'>But all the same she would not part with her
mother’s Girdle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tears flowed down Lavender’s face; she wept
softly, but through her tears she answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go away, Fairy, and do not come back again,
because you will not get the Girdle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Relya saw and heard this, his princely
blood, his noble blood, was roused within him, but
to a good purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was filled with pity for these two poor
orphans in the midst of the grisly Mount Kitesh,
defending themselves all alone against monsters and
temptations, death and destruction. “Great Heavens!”
thought he, “the princess trusted in her armed
warriors and her strongholds to defend her lands,
and the lands were lost; but these babes are left
alone in the world, they have fallen among Fairies
and Dragons, yet neither Fairies nor Dragons can
rob them of what their mother gave them.” All
Relya’s face changed as his heart went out with pity
to the children. Thus changed, he turned towards
the Votaress.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Votaress looked at Relya. Why did he raise
his sword? Was it to cut down those insolent children?
No; Relya raised the sword aloft and threatened the
wicked Fairy with it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fairy, avaunt! as if you had never been!
If you had not been my guide across the Mountain,
I would strike your fair head from off your shoulders.
I was not born a prince, nor did I forge this mighty
sword that I might roam the world a spoiler of the
fatherless!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The poor Votaress was quite frightened. She
started, and then fled to the hills. And Relya shouted
after her:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go, Fairy! call your fairies and monsters!
Prince Relya does not fear them!”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the Fairy had run off to the hills, Relya
crossed the furrow and went towards the children
on the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>How happy was Lavender when she saw a human
being coming towards them and looking at them
kindly! She sprang to her feet and stretched out
both her arms, as a captive bird spreads its wings
when you open your hand and let it go free.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lavender was quite certain that Relya had come
up only to bring them safe back from the Mountain.
She ran to Primrose, took him by the hand, and
both crossed over to Relya by the little bridge which
they had fashioned with their own tiny hands across
the reeds.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>XV</h3>

<p class='c011'>A doughty hero was Relya, and he felt strange
talking to children. But the children did not feel
in the least strange talking to a hero, because they
thought kindly of everybody, and there was no guile
in their hearts.</p>

<p class='c009'>Primrose took hold of Relya’s hand and looked
at his great sword. The sword was twice as big as
Primrose! Primrose reached up with his little hand;
he stood on tip-toe, and yet he could scarcely touch
the hilt of it. Relya looked, and never had he seen
such tiny hands beside his own. Relya was now
in a sad quandary; he forgot all about the Girdle
and Cross as he thought: “What shall I say to these
poor orphan babes? They are little and foolish,
and they do not understand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then Lavender asked Relya:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And how shall we get out of the mountains,
my lord?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, that is quite a sensible little girl,” considered
Relya. “Here am I, marvelling how small
and foolish they are, and never thinking that, after
all, we have to get out of the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Relya remembered what the Votaress had
told him about the taper and censer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen to me, little girl! The Votaress has
gone to call her sisters to help her, and I am going
on to the Mountain to meet them. Please God, I
shall overcome the Votaress Fairies, return to you by
the Holy Lake, and lead you away from the Mountain.
But if the fairies should overcome me, if I perish on the
Mountain, then do you start the fire that is not lit with
hands, light the taper and censer, and you will pass
over the Mountain as though it were a church.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Lavender heard this, she was sadly
grieved, and said to Prince Relya:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must not do that, my lord! What shall
we poor orphans do if you perish on the Mountain?
You have only just come to be our protector, and if
you were to leave us straightway and get killed
what should we do? Let us rather set to at once
and start the fire, so as to light taper and censer,
and do you, my lord, go forth with us over the
Mountain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But at that Relya became very angry, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t talk foolishness, you silly child! I was
not born a hero for taper and censer to lead me
while yet I wear sword by my side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not taper and censer will lead you, but God’s
will and commandment,” replied Lavender.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t talk foolishness, you silly child! My
sword would rust were I to be led by taper and censer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your sword will not rust when you go a-mowing
in field and meadow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Relya was troubled. It was not so much
Lavender’s words as the sweet, serious look in the
little girl’s eyes that troubled him. He knew well
enough that he would scarcely overcome the fairies
and monsters, and that he would most probably
perish if he were to go out to fight on the
Mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Little Primrose flung his arms round Relya’s
knees and looked at him coaxingly. And Relya’s
princely heart beat quick in his bosom, so that he
forgot about Cross and Girdle and fight and castle,
and all he could think was: “Well, I have to protect
and save these faithful little orphans.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will not throw away my life out of sheer
wilfulness. Come, children, start the fire, light taper
and censer; your little hands shall lead me.”</p>
<h3 class='c007'>XVI</h3>

<p class='c011'>A few moments later, and there was a wondrous
marvel to be seen on Mount Kitesh.</p>

<p class='c009'>A wide path opened all the way down the
Mountain, and on the path grew turf as soft as silk.
On the right-hand side walked little Primrose, still
in his little white shirt, and in his hand he held an
ancient wax taper, burning serenely and crackling
softly, as though it were talking with the sun. On
the left walked Lavender, wearing the Golden Girdle
and swinging a silver censer, from which rose a cloud
of white smoke. Between the two children strode
Relya, tall and strong. It seemed strange to him, in
his strength and valour, that taper and censer should
thus guide him and not his own good sword. But
he smiled gently at the children. His great sword
hung over his shoulder, and as he strode on he said
to the sword:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not fear, my faithful friend. We shall go
a-mowing in field and meadow; we shall clear scrub
and forest; we shall hew rafters and build steadings.
The sun will gild thee a thousand times while thou
art winning bread for these two orphan babes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they went across the Mountain as though it
were a church. A thin wraith of smoke rose from
the taper, and sacred odours spread from the censer.</p>

<p class='c009'>But woe and alas for the Votaresses on Mount
Kitesh! wherever the smoke and the odour of incense
spread upon the Mountain, there the Votaresses
perished and died. They made an end, each one
as it seemed most beautiful and fitting to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>One turned herself into a grey stone, and then
hurled herself down the rocks into a chasm, where
the stone broke into a thousand splinters.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second changed into a crimson flame, and
then at once went out, puff! into the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third dissolved into fine coloured dust,
scattering herself over rock and fern. And so each
of them chose what seemed to her the most beautiful
way to die.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it really didn’t matter in the least. One way
or another, they all had to leave this world, and even
the most beautiful ways of dying could not make up
for that!</p>

<p class='c009'>In this way all the seven Votaress Fairies perished,
and that is why there are no fairies, nor dragons, nor
monsters now on Mount Kitesh or anywhere else
in the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Relya and the children reached the valley
in safety, and Lavender took them to their cottage.
And only then did Relya remember why he had gone
up Mount Kitesh.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>XVII</h3>

<p class='c011'>They went into the cottage and rested a little.
Lavender, who knew where was her mother’s modest
store cupboard, brought out a little dry cheese, and
they refreshed themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now Relya was puzzled what to do about
those two orphans. Ever since they had come down
into the valley, Relya’s mind had begun to run once
more upon the castle and upon his promise to his
mother that he would bring her back the Cross and
Girdle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Therefore Relya said to Lavender:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen to me, little girl: you will have to give
me the Golden Girdle and Cross now, you and your
brother, because they belong to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we belong to you too, my lord,” said
Lavender, and looked at Relya quite astonished,
because he had not grasped that before.</p>

<p class='c009'>Relya laughed, and then he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I must take the Girdle and Cross to my
mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Lavender heard that, she cried out overjoyed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, sir, if you have a mother, do go and bring
her here to us, because we have no mother now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A stone would have wept to hear little Lavender
speak of her mother in that poor and bare little
cottage! A stone would have wept at the thought
that so lovely a child should be left all alone in the
world, when she turned to Prince Relya and begged
him to bring them a mother because their mother
was dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again Relya was filled with pity, so that he almost
wept. Therefore he bade the children good-bye
and went away to fetch his mother.</p>
<h3 class='c007'>XVIII</h3>

<p class='c011'>It took Relya seven days to return to his mother.
She was waiting for him by the window, and when
she saw him coming, lo, there was Relya coming
home without sword, Cross, or Girdle. Relya never
gave her time to ask questions, but called to her in
a gentle voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Make ready, mother, and come with me, that
we may guard what is ours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they set out together. And on the way the
Princess asked Relya whether he had found the Cross
and the Girdle, whether he had raised an army and
had reconquered their castle and lands?</p>

<p class='c009'>“I found the Girdle and Cross, mother; but
I raised no army, neither have I reconquered our lands.
We shall do better without an army, mother, for you
shall see what is left to us of our heritage,” said Relya.</p>

<p class='c009'>After seven days’ travel they reached the cabin
where Lavender and Primrose were waiting for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, my dear! but there is great joy when kind
hearts foregather! The princess hugged Lavender
and Primrose; she kissed their cheeks, eyes, hands,
and lips, and would scarcely let them go, so dear
were they to her, those orphan children from her
lost lands!</p>
<h3 class='c007'>XIX</h3>

<p class='c011'>And so they lived together in the valley, although
the little cabin was rather too small for them. But
Relya had strong hands, and he built them a little
house of stone. Their lives were uneventful, but
there was a blessing upon them. Primrose tended
the ewes and lambs, Lavender looked after the house
and garden, the princess span and sewed, and Relya
worked in the fields.</p>

<p class='c009'>The people of the village got to know the wisdom
of the princess and Relya’s strength. Presently they
remarked how well the Golden Girdle became the
princess, and, although none of them had ever seen
the princess before, they said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“She must be our noble princess.” And so they
gave Relya and the princess a great piece of land
in the valley, and begged Relya to be their leader
in all things and the princess to be their counsellor.</p>

<p class='c009'>God’s blessing was with Relya’s strength and
the princess’s wisdom. Their fields and meadows
increased; other villages joined them; gardens and
cottages sprang up in the villages.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meantime the fine lords in the castle went on
drinking and feasting as before. Now this had gone
on far too long, and although the vaults and cellars
of the castle had been the richest in seven kingdoms,
yet after so many years of waste there began to be
a lack of precious stones.</p>

<p class='c009'>First of all the gems gave out in the treasure
vaults, and then the mother-o’-pearl in the passages.
Yet a little while, and there was no more bread for
the servants, who had grown lazy. At last there was
not even meat for the bloodhounds and guards.
The faithless servants rebelled, the hounds ran
away, and the guards left their posts.</p>

<p class='c009'>But all this did not trouble the fine lords, because
they had dulled their wits with drinking and feasting.
But one fine day the wine gave out. <i>Then</i> they decided
to hold a council! They met in the great hall and
debated upon where they should get wine, because
round about the castle all was desolate: the inhabitants
had left, and the vines had run wild in
the vineyards.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the fine lords debated. But their vengeful
and rebellious servants had cut through the rafters
of the great hall, and when the lords were in the
midst of their conference the roof fell in upon them.
They were buried under the ruins of the great tower
of the castle and all of them killed.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the servants heard the tower crashing and
falling, they too deserted the castle.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so the castle was left without hounds,
servants, or fine lords, ruinous and deserted, and
dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon the news of this spread through the land,
but not a soul troubled to go and see what had happened
in the dead castle. From all sides they flocked together
and went to the foot of Mount Kitesh to beg
Relya to be their prince, because they had heard of
his strength and courage and of the wisdom of the
noble princess. Wherefore the people promised with
their own hands to build them a new castle, all
fair and stately.</p>

<p class='c009'>Relya accepted the people’s offer, because he
rightly judged that God had given him such great
strength and courage, and had delivered him from
his hot and cruel temper, so that he might be of use
to his country.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Relya became a prince; and the princess,
who was getting old by now, yet lived to see great
happiness in her old age. And when the princess
and Relya, with Lavender and Primrose, entered their
new and stately castle for the first time, the village
children scattered evergreens and sweet basil on their
path, men and woman pressed round the princess,
seized the hem of her robe and kissed it.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the princess, radiant with joy, remembered
that but for the loyalty of Lavender and Primrose
none of this would ever have come to pass. She
clasped the children to her breast and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Happy the land whose treasure is not guarded
by mighty armies or strong cities, but by the mothers
and children in shepherds’ cots. Such a land will
never perish!”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c009'>Later on Prince Relya married Lavender, and
never in the world was there a princess sweeter and
more lovely than Princess Lavender.</p>

<p class='c009'>Primrose grew up into a brave and handsome
youth. He rode a fiery dapple grey, and he would
often ride over Mount Kitesh, upon whose summit
men were building a new chapel by the Holy Lake.</p>

  <h2 id='nts' class='c004'>Notes<br /> <br />Interpretation of Names, Etc.</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>THE original names in these Fairy Tales are either
taken from Slav folk-lore or chosen or composed
so as to convey a suitable meaning. In
the English text the translator has therefore tried to
render the significance of the original names in English
in preference to reproducing the Slav names in English
spelling.</p>
<h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>How Quest Sought the Truth.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>1. <i>Bjesomar</i> (Rampogusto). The name given by the
old Slavs in some regions to the ruler of evil and malignant
forces. Analysed, the name might be translated as Cherish-goblin,
one who cares for hobgoblindom.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. <i>Svarožić</i> (All-Rosy). The ancient Slavs pictured
the sunshine in the form of a beautiful youth named
<i>Svarožić</i>, All-rose.</p>

<p class='c009'>The names of the grandfather and his three grandsons—Witting,
Bluster, Careful and Quest—are as near
as possible equivalents of the original names <i>Vjest</i>, <i>Ljutiša</i>,
<i>Marun</i> and <i>Potjeh</i>.</p>
<h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>Fisherman Plunk and his Wife.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>1. <i>Zora-djevojka</i> (the Dawn-Maiden). To this day
many old folk-tales of the Slavs tell of the Dawn-Maiden
who sails the sea in the early morning in her boat of gold
with a silver paddle and dwells in the Island of <i>Bujan</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. <i>The Sea King.</i> Slovenes and Slovaks alike tell
of a mighty and wealthy Sea King who reigns in the
depths of the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. <i>The Island of Bujan</i> (the Isle Bountiful). This
is a wonderful island, so named for its abundance and
fruitfulness and luxuriant vegetation. It was the ancient
Slav’s conception of Paradise. To this day the Russians
mention it in refrains and spells against sickness, for a
plentiful harvest, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. <i>The Stone Alatir</i> (Gold-a-Fire). Is mentioned in
ancient Slav tales as “the white burning stone on Bujan,”
and may perhaps be taken to stand for the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. <i>Sea Maidens</i> (Mermaids). In Slovene and Croatian
folk-tales, as with us, this term is applied to fabulous sea
creatures, which are beautiful women to the waist, and
from the waist downward shaped like a forked fish tail.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. <i>The dumb speech.</i> The Jugoslavs popularly believe
that animals converse with each other in a special “language,”
and that certain human beings can “speak” and understand
this “language.”</p>

<p class='c009'>7. <i>The Monstrous Snake</i>, the <i>Bird with the Iron Beak</i>,
the <i>Golden Bee</i>. Three monsters which, according to folk-tales,
stir up the waves, raise tempests, and provoke
thunderstorms round the Isle of Bujan, whence the storms
spread throughout the world.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Palunko</i> (Plunk) has no special significance, but the
sound suggests a doleful, feckless sort of person.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Winpeace</i> is a translation of Vlatko.</p>
<h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>Reygoch.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>1. <i>Legen</i> (<i>Ledjan</i>) (Frosten city). An ancient marvellous
city which is mentioned in Croatian folk-songs
and tradition. <i>Leden</i> means <i>frozen</i>, <i>icy</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. <i>Regoč</i>, <i>Regoc</i> (Reygoch). A huge simple giant of
fairy kin. He is mentioned by the poet <i>Gjorgjić</i>, of
Dubrovnik (Ragusa), in his <i>Marunko</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The name <i>Kosjenka</i> is derived from <i>kose</i> (hair), and
indicates the little fairy’s flowing tresses.</p>

<p class='c009'>Apart from being a simple fairy-tale, this story contains
an allegorical element. <i>Reygoch</i>, the benevolent, simple-minded
giant, is a character from <i>Marunko</i>, by the poet
Gjorgjić, of Dubrovnik. The city of <i>Legen</i>, or <i>Ledjan</i>
(which, to all intents and purposes, means “frozen”),
is to be found in Croatian folk-tales and ballads.</p>
<h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bridesman Sun and Bride Bridekins.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>1. <i>Mokoš</i> (Muggish). A mighty force which, according
to the beliefs of the ancient Slavs, ruled the earth, and
especially in marshlands. She is mentioned in connection
with the heavenly thunder god. <i>Perun</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. <i>Kolede</i> (translated by <i>Yuletide</i>) A winter festival
celebrated at the end of December in honour of the sun,
whose power once more begins to increase in those days.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. <i>Krijes</i> (translated by <i>Beltane</i>). A festival in
honour of the summer sun at the time of his greatest
strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. <i>Omaja</i>, <i>omaha</i>. Water which is flung from the
mill-wheel. To this day peasants bathe children in this
water so that evil may be turned away from them.</p>

<p class='c009'>A <i>Ban</i> is a Warden of the Marches.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Neva</i> means <i>bride</i>. <i>Nevičica</i> is the diminutive of <i>Neva</i>.</p>
<h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>Stribor’s Forest.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>1. <i>Domaći</i> (“home sprites,” from <i>dom</i>, house, home),
Brownies. In all Slav nations this is the name given to
the little domestic sprites which haunt the hearth. They
are sometimes harmful and sometimes beneficent.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. <i>Malik Tintilinić</i> (Wee Tintilinkie). Old popular
name for one of the most lively of these <i>domaći</i>.</p>
<h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>Little Brother Primrose and Sister Lavender.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>1. <i>Kitež</i> (Mount Kitesh). The Russian author
Merežkovski mentions the mysterious Kitež region, an
uninhabited forest, and the Lake Svetlojar (which latter
name might very well be transliterated by the <i>Holy Lake</i>),
which used to be inhabited by all sorts of monsters.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. <i>Vile Zatočnice</i> (Votaress Fairies). The term
<i>Votaress snakes</i> (<i>zmije zatočnice</i>) is popularly applied to
snakes which are supposed to have taken a vow in the
autumn not to go to sleep for the winter without having
killed somebody.</p>

<p class='c009'>3 <i>Relya</i> (<i>Hrelja</i>). A Croatian ballad makes mention
of a certain Hrelja as a better and stronger hero than
even Kraljević Mark.</p>

<p class='c009'>The names <i>Rutvica</i> and <i>Jaglenac</i> have simply been
translated into <i>Lavender</i> and <i>Primrose</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Bukač</i> is derived from <i>buka</i>, noise. Hence <i>Belleroo</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Medunkda</i>, from <i>medved</i>, a bear (Bruineen).</p>

<p class='c009'>The term <i>božjak</i> (applied to Relya), which suggests
a powerful, poverty-stricken churl, the translator has sought
to render by <i>rowfoot</i> (a rough fellow).</p>
